&lt;p>整理之前的各种笔记和资源，慢慢会优化分类。&lt;/p>

&lt;p>书籍资源大多可以在这个网站上搜到：&lt;a href="https://book4you.org/?signAll=1&amp;amp;ts=0531">zlibrary&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>一些文章和网站需要翻墙才能看到，相关机场的测速和简介可以在这里找到：&lt;a href="https://www.duyaoss.com/">duyaoss&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>CAPTAIN AOLAO-OLAO S REPORT&lt;br>
船长奥劳-奥劳的报告&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have spent near forty days on this world they call Se-ri or Ye-ha-ri, well entertained, and leave with as good an estimation of the natives as is consonant with their unregenerate state. They live in fine great buildings they call castles, with large parks all about. Outside the walls of the parks lie well-tilled fields and abundant orchards, reclaimed by diligence from the parched and arid desert of stone that makes up the greatest part of the land. Their women live in villages and towns huddled outside the walls. All the common work of farm and mill is performed by the women, of whom there is a vast superabundance. They are ordinary drudges, living in towns which belong to the lords of the castle. They live amongst the cattle and brute animals of all kinds, who are permitted into the houses, some of which are of fair size. These women go about drably clothed, always in groups and bands. They are never allowed within the walls of the park, leaving the food and necessaries with which they provide the men at the outer gate of the castle. They evinced great fear and distrust of us. A few of my men following some girls on the road, women rushed from the town like a pack of wild beasts, so that the men thought it best to return forthwith to the castle. Our hosts advised us that it were best for us to keep away from their towns, which we did.&lt;br>
我们在这个他们称作Se-ri或Ye-ha-ri的世界上度过了近四十天，受到了良好的招待，对于这些未被感化的土著居民的评价也不错。他们居住在他们称之为城堡的豪华建筑中，并拥有广阔的园林。在园林围墙之外，是经过勤劳耕作，从干旱多石的荒漠中开垦出的良田果园。他们的女人住在城镇的外围，在城墙之外簇拥形成社区。所有的农活和磨坊活都由这些女人完成，她们的数量非常庞大。她们过着平凡的生活，居住在城堡的领主们所管辖的城镇里。她们和家畜以及各种动物生活在一起，这些动物被允许进入其中一些相当大的住宅。这些女人们穿着朴素，总是成群成队地出门。她们永远不允许进入城堡园林的围墙内，只在城堡外的大门处提供食物和必需品为男人服务。她们对于我们表现出极大的恐惧和不信任。有几个人在路上追着一些女孩子走，结果来自城镇的女人们像一群野兽一样冲了出来，这使得男人们觉得最好立即返回城堡。我们的主人建议我们远离她们的城镇，而我们也照做了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The men go freely about their great parks, playing at one sport or another. At night they go to certain houses which they own in the town, where they may have their pick among the women and satisfy their lust upon them as they will. The women pay them, we were told, in their money, which is copper, for a night of pleasure, and pay them yet more if they get a child on them. Their nights thus are spent in carnal satisfaction as often as they desire, and their days in a diversity of sports and games, notably a kind of wrestling, in which they throw each other through the air so that we marveled that they seemed never to take hurt, but rose up and returned to the combat with wonderful dexterity of hand and foot. Also they fence with blunt swords, and combat with long light sticks. Also they play a game with balls on a great field, using the arms to catch or throw the ball and the legs to kick the ball and trip or catch or kick the men of the other team, so that many are bruised and lamed in the passion of the sport, which was very fine to see, the teams in their contrasted garments of bright colors much gauded out with gold and finery seething now this way, now that, up and down the field in a mass, from which the balls were flung up and caught by runners breaking free of the struggling crowd and fleeting towards the one or the other goal with all the rest in hot pursuit. There is a “battlefield” as they call it of this game lying without the walls of the castle park, near to the town, so that the women may come watch and cheer, which they do heartily, calling out the names of favorite players and urging them with many uncouth cries to victory.&lt;br>
男人们自由地在他们的大公园里玩各种运动。晚上，他们会去城里他们拥有的某些房子，可以在那里选择女人，随心所欲地满足他们的欲望。我们听说，女人们会用他们的铜钱支付他们，以换取一夜的快感。如果他们怀孕了，他们需要付更多的钱。因此，他们的夜晚充满了肉欲的满足，他们的白天则是在各种运动和游戏中度过，尤其是摔跤，在这种摔跤中，他们互相抛来抛去，让我们惊奇地发现，他们似乎从未受伤，而且手脚的灵活性也非常出色。此外，他们还用钝剑决斗，以及用长而轻的木棍进行战斗。他们还在一个巨大的球场上玩一个用手臂接住或投掷球，用腿踢球并绊倒、抓住或踢对方球队球员的游戏。在这个激烈的比赛中，许多人在运动的激情中受了伤，但这种运动非常精彩，两队身穿明亮对比色彩的华服，以金子和装饰物为傅，此起彼伏地在场上来回穿梭。比赛场地被称为“战场”，坐落在城堡公园外的城市附近，以便女人们能够观看和为他们加油，她们会用许多奇怪的呼喊，热情地为她们钟爱的球员加油打气。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Boys are taken from the women at the age of eleven and brought to the castle to be educated as befits a man. We saw such a child brought into the castle with much ceremony and rejoicing. It is said that the women find it difficult to bring a pregnancy of a manchild to term, and that of those born many die in infancy despite the care lavished upon them, so that there are far more women than men. In this we see the curse of GOD laid upon this race as upon all those who acknowledge HIM not, unrepentant heathens whose ears are stopped to true discourse and blind to the light.&lt;br>
男孩在十一岁时被从妇女中带走，带到城堡里接受适当的男子教育。我们看到一个这样的孩子在盛大的仪式和欢庆中被带进城堡。据说妇女很难生育男婴，许多出生的男婴尽管受到精心照料，仍在婴儿期夭折，因此女性比男性更多。在这里，我们看到上帝的诅咒降临在这个种族上，就像在那些不认识他的不悔改的异教徒身上一样，他们的耳朵对真实的言论是聋的，对光明是盲的。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These men know little of art, only a kind of leaping dance, and their science is little beyond that of savages. One great man of a castle to whom I talked, who was dressed out in cloth of gold and crimson and whom all called Prince and Grandsire with much respect and deference, yet was so ignorant he believed the stars to be worlds full of people and beasts, asking us from which star we descended. They have only vessels driven by steam along the surface of the land and water, and no notion of flight either in the air or in space, nor any curiosity about such things, saying with disdain, “That is all women’s work,” and indeed I found that if I asked these great men about matters of common knowledge such as the working of machinery, the weaving of cloth, the transmission of holovision, they would soon chide me for taking interest in womanish things as they called them, desiring me to talk as befit a man.&lt;br>
这些人对艺术知之甚少，只懂一种跳跃舞蹈，他们的科学水平也不过是野蛮人的水平。我曾和一位住在城堡里身穿金红色绸缎的伟大人物谈话。人们都毕恭毕敬地称他为王子和爷爷。然而，他非常无知，他认为星星是人和野兽居住的世界，询问我们是从哪颗星球来的。他们只有靠蒸汽推动的车辆行驶在陆地和水面上，对于空中或空间的飞行毫无概念，也没有任何好奇心，表示轻蔑道：“那是女人的活儿。”事实上，我发现如果我询问这些伟大的人关于通识知识的事情，比如机械的工作、布料的编织、全息视像的传输等等，他们很快就会责备我对所谓的女性事物产生兴趣，让我像个男子汉一样谈话。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the breeding of their fierce cattle within the parks they are very knowledgeable, as in the sewing up of their clothing, which they make from cloth the women weave in their factories. The men vie in the ornamentation and magnificence of their costumes to an extent en, swhich we might indeed have thought scarcely manly, were they not withal such proper mtrong and ready for any game or sport, and full of pride and a most delicate and fiery honor.&lt;br>
在他们的公园中饲养凶猛的牛时，他们非常有经验，就像缝制自己的服装一样，这些服装是女性在工厂中编织的布料制成的。男人们在装饰和华丽的服装上争相展现，从某种程度上来说，我们可能认为这不是很男子气概，但是，他们是如此强壮、随时准备进行任何运动或比赛，并且充满自豪感和最为精致而热情的荣誉感。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The log including Captain Aolao-olao’s entries was (after a 12-generation journey) returned to the Sacred Archives of the Universe on Iao, which were dispersed during the period called The Tumult, and eventually preserved in fragmentary form on Hain. There is no record of further contact with Seggri until the First Observers were sent by the Ekumen in 93/1333: an Alterran man and a Hainish woman, Kaza Agad and G. Merriment. After a year in orbit mapping, photographing, recording and studying broadcasts, and analyzing and learning a major regional language, the Observers landed. Acting upon a strong persuasion of the vulnerability of the planetary culture, they presented themselves as survivors of the wreck of a fishing boat, blown far off course, from a remote island. They were, as they had anticipated, separated at once, Kaza Agad being taken to the Castle and Merriment into the town. Kaza kept his name, which was plausible in the native context; Merriment called herself Yude. We have only her report, from which three excerpts follow.&lt;/em>&lt;br>
&lt;em>船长奥拉奥拉的日志（经过12代人的旅程）被归还到了宇宙神圣档案馆的耀星，这里的档案在“动乱”期间被散布到各处，最终以残缺的形式保存在海恩星上。直到93/1333年，埃克文派出了首批观察员卡扎·阿加德和G·梅里曼特前往，才有了与塞格里星的进一步联系。在绕轨道地图制作、拍照、记录和学习广播、分析和学习该地区重要的语言一年后，观察员降落。考虑到该星球文化的脆弱性，他们自称鱼船失事幸存者，被风吹到偏远海岛。一如他们预料的那样，他们立即被分开，卡扎·阿加德被带进城堡，梅里曼特则在城镇里。卡扎保留了自己的名字，而梅里曼特则改称为Yude。我们唯一得到的是她的报告，以下是三段摘录。&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>FROM MOBILE GERINDU’UTTAHAYUDETWE’MENRADE MERRIMENT’S NOTES FOR A REPORT TO THE EKUMEN, 93/133&lt;br>
从移动格林度塔哈尤德特韦门拉德快乐笔记，为向厄库门报告所做的报告，93/133。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>34/223 Their network of trade and information, hence their awareness of what goes on elsewhere in their world, is too sophisticated for me to maintain my Stupid Foreign Castaway act any longer. Ekhaw called me in today and said, “If we had a sire here who was worth buying or if our teams were winning their games, I’d think you were a spy. Who are you, anyhow?”&lt;br>
34/223 他们的贸易和信息网络，因此对于他们所处的世界的其他地方发生的事情的认知，对我来说过于复杂以致于我无法再保持我的愚蠢的外国漂泊者的行为了。埃卡赫今天叫我过去，并说：“如果我们这里有值得购买的种猪或者如果我们的队伍赢得比赛，我会认为你是间谍。 你到底是谁？”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I said, “Would you let me go to the College at Hagka?”&lt;br>
我说：“你能让我去哈加学院吗？”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She said, “Why?”&lt;br>
她问：“为什么？”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“There are scientists there, I think? I need to talk with them.”&lt;br>
那里有科学家，我想吗？我需要和他们谈话。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This made sense to her; she made their “Mh” noise of assent.&lt;br>
这让她感到有道理了；她发出了他们习惯发出的附和的“嗯”声。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Could my friend go there with me?”&lt;br>
&amp;quot;我的朋友能和我一起去那里吗？&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Shask, you mean?”&lt;br>
&amp;quot;你说的是Shask吗？&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were both puzzled for a moment. She didn’t expect a woman to call a man “friend,” and I hadn’t thought of Shask as a friend. She’s very young, and I haven’t taken her very seriously.&lt;br>
我们俩都有些困惑。她没想到一个女人会称呼一个男人为“朋友”，而我也没觉得夏斯克是我的朋友。她非常年轻，我也没有很认真地看待她。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I mean Kaza, the man I came with.”&lt;br>
“我是指卡扎，我来时的那个人。”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“A man — to the college?” she said, incredulous. She looked at me and said, “Where &lt;em>do&lt;/em> you come from?”&lt;br>
“一个男人到学院去？”她表示怀疑地说道。她看着我说，“你是从哪里来的啊？”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a fair question, not asked in enmity or challenge. I wish I could have answered it, but I am increasingly convinced that we can do great damage to these people; we are facing Resehavanar’s Choice here, I fear.&lt;br>
这是一个公正的问题，不是出于敌意或挑战而提出的。我希望我能回答它，但我越来越相信我们可能会对这些人造成巨大的伤害；我担心在这里我们面临着瑞斯哈瓦纳尔的选择。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ekhaw paid for my journey to Hagka, and Shask came along with me. As I thought about it I saw that of course Shask was my friend. It was she who brought me into the motherhouse, persuading Ekhaw and Azman of their duty to be hospitable; it was she who had looked out for me all along. Only she was so conventional in everything she did and said that I hadn’t realized how radical her compassion was. When I tried to thank her, as our little jitney-bus purred along the road to Hagka, she said things like she always says —”Oh, we’re all family,” and “People have to help each other,” and “Nobody can live alone.”&lt;br>
艾卡维支付了我的前往哈格卡之旅的费用，沙斯克跟我一起来。我想到她是我的朋友，她将我引入了母亲之家，说服艾卡维和阿兹曼履行好客的职责；她一直都在照顾我。只是她在所做所说的一切方面都非常传统，我没有意识到她的同情心有多么激进。当我们坐在小型公交车上向哈格卡前进时，我试图感谢她，她说了像平常一样的话，比如“哦，我们都是一家人”，“人们要互相帮助”，“没有人能独自生活”。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Don’t women ever live alone?” I asked her, for all the ones I’ve met belong to a motherhouse or a daughterhouse, whether a couple or a big family like Ekhaw’s, which is three generations: five older women, three of their daughters living at home, and four children —the boy they all coddle and spoil so, and three girls.&lt;br>
“女人从不独居吗？”我问她。因为我遇到的所有女性都居住在母屋或女儿屋中，无论是夫妻还是像艾卡的大家庭一样的三代人：五个年长的女人，其中三个女儿住在家里，还有四个孩子——他们都娇惯和溺爱的男孩和三个女孩。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Oh yes,” Shask said. “If they don’t want wives, they can be singlewomen. And old women, when their wives die, sometimes they just live alone till they die. Usually they go live at a daughterhouse. In the colleges, the &lt;em>vev&lt;/em> always have a place to be alone.” Conventional she may be, but Shask always tries to answer a question seriously and completely; she thinks about her answer. She has been an invaluable informant. She has also made life easy for me by not asking questions about where I come from. I took this for the incuriosity of a person securely embedded in an unquestioned way of life, and for the self-centeredness of the young. Now I see it as delicacy.&lt;br>
&amp;quot;是的,&amp;quot; Shask 说道. &amp;quot;如果他们不想要妻子，他们可以选择做单身女性。而那些老年妇女，当她们的妻子去世时，有时只能独自生活，直到她们离世。通常她们会去女儿家。在大学中， &lt;em>vev&lt;/em>总是有一个独处的地方。&amp;quot; Shask 虽然循规蹈矩，但总是认真且全面地回答问题；她会仔细思考。她是一位非常有价值的消息来源。她未曾询问我来自何方而使我的生活更加轻松。我一开始认为这是身处无可置疑的生活中的人对自身的不关心，以及年轻人的自我中心。现在，我将这视为一种细致周到的体贴。&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“A vev is a teacher?”&lt;br>
&amp;quot;vev是老师吗？&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Mh.”&lt;br>
“嗯。”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“And the teachers at the college are very respected?”&lt;br>
“这所大学的教师受到很高的尊重？”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“That’s what vev means. That’s why we call Eckaw’s mother Vev Kakaw. She didn’t go to college, but she’s a thoughtful person, she’s learned from life, she has a lot to teach us.”&lt;br>
这就是vev的意思。这就是为什么我们称Eckaw的母亲为“Vev Kakaw”。她没有上过大学，但她是一个 thoughtful 的人，她从生活中学到了很多东西，她有很多东西可以教给我们。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So respect and teaching are the same thing, and the only term of respect I’ve heard women use for women means teacher. And so in teaching me, young Shask respects herself? And/or earns my respect? This casts a different light on what I’ve been seeing as a society in which wealth is the important thing. Zadedr, the current mayor of Reha, is certainly admired for her very ostentatious display of possessions; but they don’t call her Vev.&lt;br>
所以尊重和教学是一回事，我听过女性用来称呼其他女性的唯一尊称是老师。所以当年幼的莎斯克教导我，是在尊重她自己？或是在赢得我的尊重？这让我对我一直以来认为财富至上的社会有了不同的看法。雷哈镇现任市长扎德德尔被人们敬仰，因为她炫耀她那财产显眼的陈列，但她们没有称呼她为维夫。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I said to Shask, “You have taught me so much, may I call you Vev Shask?”&lt;br>
我对沙斯克说：“您教了我那么多，我能称呼您为维夫·沙斯克吗？”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She was equally embarrassed and pleased, and squirmed and said, “Oh no no no no.” Then she said, “If you ever come back to Reha I would like very much to have love with you, Yude.”&lt;br>
她既尴尬又高兴，扭动着身体说，“哦不不不，不要这样。” 然后她说，“如果你再回到热哈，我很想和你谈恋爱，雨德。”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I thought you were in love with Sire Zadr!” I blurted out.&lt;br>
&amp;quot;我以为你爱上了扎德勋爵！&amp;quot; 我失言道。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Oh, I am,” she said, with that eye-roll and melted look they have when they speak of the sires, “aren’t you? Just think of him fucking you, oh! Oh, I get all wet thinking about it!” She smiled and wriggled. I felt embarrassed in my turn and probably showed it. “Don’t you like him?” she inquired with a naivety I found hard to bear. She was acting like a silly adolescent, and I know she’s not a silly adolescent. “But I’ll never be able to afford him,” she said, and sighed.&lt;br>
“哦，我是”，她用那种鄙视的眼神和融化的神情说道，当他们谈及继承人时，她们就是如此。“你不是吗？想想他与你做爱，哦！噫！我想想就湿了！”她微笑着扭动身体。轮到我尴尬了，我也许表现出来。她神清气爽地问道，“你不喜欢他吗？”我发现很难忍受她的纯真。她表现得像个傻乎乎的青少年，而我知道她不是个傻乎乎的青少年。“但我永远也买不起他，”她叹了口气。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So you want to make do with me, I thought nastily.&lt;br>
我心里恶意地想：你想和我凑合过日子，是吗？&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I’m going to save my money,” she announced after a minute. “I think I want to have a baby next year. Of course I can’t afford Sire Zadr, he’s a Great Champion, but if I don’t go to the Games at Kadaki this year I can save up enough for a really good sire at our fuckery, maybe Master Rosra. I wish, I know this is silly, I’m going to say it anyway, I’ve been wishing you could be its lovemother. I know you can’t, you have to go to the college. I just wanted to tell you. I love you.” She took my hands, drew them to her face, pressed my palms on her eyes for a moment, and then released me. She was smiling, but her tears were on my hands.&lt;br>
“我要省钱，”她说了一会儿，“我想明年要个孩子。当然，我买不起赛尔扎德，他是位伟大的冠军，但如果我今年不去卡达基游戏，我可以攒够足够好的蓝厅种马，也许是罗斯拉爷爷。我知道这很傻，但我还是希望你能成为孩子的养母。我知道你做不到，你要去上大学，但我就是想告诉你。我爱你。”她握住了我的手，把它们放在她的脸上，用力地让我的手掌覆盖着她的双眼，然后放开了我。她笑着，但她的泪水却落在了我的手上。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Oh, Shask,” I said, floored.&lt;br>
&amp;quot;哦，沙斯克,&amp;quot; 我傻眼了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“It’s all right!” she said. “I have to cry a minute.” And she did. She wept openly, bending over, wringing her hands, and wailing softly. I patted her arm and felt unutterably ashamed of myself. Other passengers looked round and made little sympathetic grunting noises. One old woman said, “That’s it, that’s right, lovey!” In a few minutes Shask stopped crying, wiped her nose and face on her sleeve, drew a long, deep breath, and said, “All right.” She smiled at me. “Driver,” she called, “I have to piss, can we stop?”&lt;br>
“没关系，”她说，“我得哭一分钟。”她哭了起来，痛哭流涕，弯着腰，揪着双手，轻声呜咽。我拍了拍她的胳膊，感到无比羞愧。其他乘客转过身，发出小小的同情声音。一位老妇人说：“没错，没错，亲爱的！”几分钟后，沙斯克停止哭泣，用袖子擦了擦鼻子和脸，深深地吸了口气，说：“好了。”她冲我微笑。“司机，”她喊道，“我得上厕所，能停一下吗？”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The driver, a tense-looking woman, growled something, but stopped the bus on the wide, weedy roadside; and Shask and another woman got off and pissed in the weeds. There is an enviable simplicity to many acts in a society which has, in all its daily life, only one gender. And which, perhaps — I don’t know this but it occurred to me then, while I was ashamed of myself — has no shame?&lt;br>
司机是个紧张的女人，咕哝了几句话，但最终停车在了一片杂草丛生的路边；Shask和另一个女人下车，在草丛中解决了个人问题。在一个只有一个性别的社会里，许多行为显得非常简单而令人羡慕。或许该社会——我不确定，但在我当时感到惭愧的时候，这种想法就涌上了心头——并没有羞耻之心。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>34/245. (Dictated) Still nothing from Kaza. I think I was right to give him the ansible. I hope he’s in touch with somebody. I wish it was me. I need to know what goes on in the castles.&lt;br>
34/245。（口述）卡扎还是没有消息。我想我把安比克斯礼物送给他是对的。我希望他跟某个人保持联系。我希望是我。我需要知道城堡里发生了什么。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyhow I understand better now what I was seeing at the Games in Reha. There are sixteen adult women for every adult man. One conception in six or so is male, but a lot of nonviable male fetuses and defective male births bring it down to one in sixteen by puberty. My ancestors must have really had fun playing with these people’s chromosomes. I feel guilty, even if it was a million years ago. I have to learn to do without shame but had better not forget the one good use of guilt. Anyhow. A fairly small town like Reha shares its castle with other towns. That confusing spectacle I was taken to on my tenth day down was Awaga Castle trying to keep its place in the Maingame against a castle from up north, and losing. Which means Awaga’s team can’t play in the big game this year in Fadrga, the city south of here, from which the winners go on to compete in the &lt;em>big&lt;/em> big game at Zask, where people come from all over the continent — hundreds of contestants and thousands of spectators. I saw some holos of last year’s Maingame at Zask. There were 1,280 players, the comment said, and forty balls in play. It looked to me like a total mess, my idea of a battle between two unarmed armies, but I gather that great skill and strategy is involved. All the members of the winning team get a special title for the year, and another one for life, and bring glory back to their various castles and the towns that support them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>无论如何，我现在更明白我在雷哈游戏中看到的是什么了。每个成年男子有十六个成年女子。大约每六个概念中就有一个是男性, 但许多无法存活的男性胎儿和有缺陷的男性出生将其降低到十六分之一。我的祖先一定玩得很开心地与这些人的染色体。即使是一百万年前，我也感到内疚。我必须学会没有羞耻感，但最好不要忘记有罪感的一个好用途。无论如何。像雷哈这样的一个相当小的城镇与其他城镇共享它的城堡。第十天我被带到了混乱的景象，那就是阿瓦加城堡试图在来自北方的城堡的 Maingame 中保持其地位，但失败了。这意味着 Awaga 的团队今年不能参加南面的 Fadrga 城市的大比赛，而获胜者将继续参加在扎斯克的&lt;em>大&lt;/em>大比赛，从那里来自整个大陆的人们——数百名选手和数千名观众。我看到了去年扎斯克 Maingame 的一些 Holos。评论说有1,280名球员，四十个球在比赛中。对我来说它看起来像两个手无寸铁的军队之间的战斗，但我了解到需要极大的技能和策略。所有获胜团队成员都会在一年内获得特殊称号，还有一生。他们为他们的各种城堡和支持他们的城镇带来荣耀。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can now get some sense of how this works, see the system from outside it, because the college doesn’t support a castle. People here aren’t obsessed with sports and athletes and sexy sires the way the young women in Reha were, and some of the older ones. It’s a kind of obligatory obsession. Cheer your team, support your brave men, adore your local hero. It makes sense. Given their situation, they need strong, healthy men at their fuckery; it’s social selection reinforcing natural selection. But I’m glad to get away from the rah-rah and the swooning and the posters of fellows with swelling muscles and huge penises and bedroom eyes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我现在能够有些了解它是如何运作的，从它的外部看到这个系统，因为学院不支持堡垒式管理。这里的人们不会像Reha的年轻女孩和一些老年女性一样痴迷于运动员和性感英雄。这是一种强制性的痴迷，为你的团队喝彩，支持你勇敢的男人，崇拜你的本地英雄。这是有意义的，考虑到他们的处境，他们需要在他们的性生活中拥有强壮，健康的男性；这是一种社会选择，使自然选择得到加强。但我很高兴能够远离那些喧闹的声音、眩晕的人群和那些肌肉膨胀、生殖器巨大、卧室之眼海报。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have made Resehavanar’s Choice. I chose the option: Less than the truth. Shoggrad and Skodr and the other teachers, professors we’d call them, are intelligent, enlightened people, perfectly capable of understanding the concept of space travel, etc., making decisions about technological innovation, etc. I limit my answers to their questions to technology. I let them assume, as most people naturally assume, particularly people from a monoculture, that our society is pretty much like theirs. When they find how it differs, the effect will be revolutionary, and I have no mandate, reason, or wish to cause such a revolution on Seggri.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我已经做出了Resehavanar的决定。我选择了选项：不如实。Shoggrad、Skodr和其他老师、教授们是聪明、开明的人，完全能理解太空旅行等概念，做出有关技术创新等方面的决策。我仅限于回答他们有关技术的问题。我让他们假设，像大多数人一样，特别是来自单一文化的人，我们的社会与他们的社会基本相似。当他们发现它们的不同之处时，将产生革命性的影响，而我没有受到任何授权、原因或愿望来在Seggri引起这样的革命。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their gender imbalance has produced a society in which, as far as I can tell, the men have all the privilege and the women have all the power. It’s obviously a stable arrangement. According to their histories, it’s lasted at least two millennia, and probably in some form or another much longer than that. But it could be quickly and disastrously destabilised by contact with us, by their experiencing the human norm. I don’t know if the men would cling to their privileged status or demand freedom, but surely the women would resist giving up their power, and their sexual system and affectional relationships would break down. Even if they learned to undo the genetic program that was inflicted on them, it would take several generations to restore normal gender distribution. I can’t be the whisper that starts that avalanche.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他们的性别失衡产生了一个社会，据我所知，男性拥有所有特权，而女性拥有所有权力。这显然是一种稳定的安排。根据他们的历史，它已经持续了至少两千年，而且可能以某种形式延续了更长的时间。但是，我们的接触可能会很快而灾难性地破坏这种稳定，他们可能会经历到人类的标准。我不知道男性是否会坚持他们的特权地位或要求自由，但女性肯定会抵制放弃她们的权力，她们的性系统和感情关系将会崩溃。即使他们学会了撤销对他们施加的基因程序，也需要几代人才能恢复正常的性别分配。我不能成为引发那场雪崩的耳语。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>34/266. (Dictated) Skodr got nowhere with the men of Awaga Castle. She had to make her inquiries very cautiously, since it would endanger Kaza if she told them he was an alien or in any way unique. They’d take it as a claim of superiority, which he’d have to defend in trials of strength and skill. I gather that the hierarchies within the castles are a rigid framework, within which a man moves up or down issuing challenges and winning or losing obligatory and optional trials. The sports and games the women watch are only the showpieces of an endless series of competitions going on inside the castles. As an untrained, grown man Kaza would be at a total disadvantage in such trials. The only way he might get out of them, she said, would be by feigning illness or idiocy. She thinks he must have done so, since he is at least alive; but that’s all she could find out — “The man who was cast away at Taha-Reha is alive.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>34/266.（口述）斯科德尔在阿瓦加城的男人们面前无法取得任何进展。她必须非常谨慎地进行调查，因为如果她告诉他们卡扎是外星人或任何独特的方式，那么将会危及卡扎。他们将把它视为优越性的主张，在力量和技巧的考验中必须加以辩护。我了解到，城堡内的等级制度是一个严格的框架，一个人通过发起挑战并赢得或输掉必须和可选的考验来上升或下降。女性观看的体育比赛只是城堡内无休止的竞争中的示范赛。作为一个没有训练的成年男子，卡扎在这样的考验中处于完全劣势。她说，他唯一可能摆脱这些困境的方式是装病或装傻。她认为他必须这么做了，因为他至少还活着；但这是她能找到的所有信息——“在塔哈-雷哈丢失的那个人还活着。”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the women feed, house, clothe, and support the lords of the castle, they evidently take their noncooperation for granted. She seemed glad to get even that scrap of information. As I am.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>虽然这些妇女为城堡领主提供食物、住所、衣服和支持，但他们显然认为她们不配合是理所当然的。她似乎很高兴得到了这一点信息。我也是。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But we have to get Kaza out of there. The more I hear about it from Skodr the more dangerous it sounds. I keep thinking “spoiled brats!” but actually these men must be more like soldiers in the training camps that militarists have. Only the training never ends. As they win trials they gain all kinds of titles and ranks you could translate as “generals” and the other names militarists have for all their power-grades. Some of the “generals,” the Lords and Masters and so on, are the sports idols, the darlings of the fuckeries, like the one poor Shask adored; but as they get older apparently they often trade glory among the women for power among the men, and become tyrants within their castle, bossing the “lesser” men around, until they’re overthrown, kicked out. Old sires often live alone, it seems, in little houses away from the main castle, and are considered crazy and dangerous — rogue males.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>但我们必须让卡扎走出那里。从斯科德的口中听到的越多，它听起来越危险。我一直在想“被宠坏的孩子！”，但实际上，这些男人必须更像军营里的士兵，而不是那些军国主义者。只是这种训练永远不会结束。随着他们赢得试炼，他们获得各种头衔和军衔，可以翻译为“将军”和军国主义者为他们所有权级别命名的其他名称。一些“将军”，像贵族和大师等，是体育偶像，荒淫无度的宠儿，就像可怜的沙斯克所崇拜的那个一样；但随着他们变老，显然他们经常把光彩交给了妇女换取在男人中间的权力，并成为城堡内的暴君，指挥“较低级”的男人，直到他们被推翻，被踢出去。老爷们经常独居，似乎住在远离主城堡的小房子里，被认为是疯狂和危险的——流浪的雄性。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It sounds like a miserable life. All they’re allowed to do after age eleven is compete at games and sports inside the castle, and compete in the fuckeries, after they’re fifteen or so, for money and number of fucks and so on. Nothing else. No options. No trades. No skills of making. No travel unless they play in the big games. They aren’t allowed into the colleges to gain any kind of freedom of mind. I asked Skodr why an intelligent man couldn’t at least come study in the college, and she told me that learning was very bad for men: it weakens a man’s sense of honor, makes his muscles flabby, and leaves him impotent. ” ‘What goes to the brain takes from the testicles,'” she said. “Men have to be sheltered from education for their own good.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>听起来是一种悲惨的生活。十一岁以后，他们只能在城堡内参加游戏和体育比赛，并参加一些交换性行为，十五岁左右开始挣钱、统计性行为次数等等。没有其他选择。没有交易。没有制作技能。除非他们参加大比赛，否则不允许旅行。他们不被允许进入大学获得任何自由思想的自由。我问斯科德为什么聪明的男人不能至少来上大学学习，她告诉我学习对男人来说非常不好：它削弱一个男人的荣誉感，使他的肌肉变软，让他性无能。 “头脑活动会影响男性的生殖功能，”她说。“对于男人来说，必须远离教育，这是为了他们自己好。”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried to “be water,” as I was taught, but I was disgusted. Probably she felt it, because after a while she told me about “the secret college.” Some women in colleges do smuggle information to men in castles. The poor things meet secretly and teach each other. In the castles, homosexual relationships are encouraged among boys under fifteen, but not officially tolerated among grown men; she says the “secret colleges” often are run by the homosexual men. They have to be secret because if they’re caught reading or talking about ideas they may be punished by their Lords and Masters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我尝试着“像水一样”，就像我曾经被教导过的，但我感到恶心。或许她能感觉到，因为过了一会儿她告诉我“秘密学院”的事情。一些女性在学院里会向城堡里的男性走私信息。这些可怜的女性们秘密见面并相互教导。在城堡里，15岁以下的男孩之间的同性关系是被鼓励的，但是成年男性之间是不被官方容忍的；她说“秘密学院”通常是由同性恋男性管理的，他们不得不保密，因为如果他们被发现阅读或者谈论有关思想的问题，可能会受到组织者的惩罚。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There have been some interesting works from the “secret colleges,” Skodr said, but she had to think to come up with examples. One was a man who had smuggled out an interesting mathematical theorem, and one was a painter whose landscapes, though primitive in technique, were admired by professionals of the art. She couldn’t remember his name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>从“秘密学院”中涌现出了一些有趣的作品，Skodr说道，但她得思考一下才能举出例子。一个是偷运出有趣的数学定理的人，另一个是一位画家，他的风景画虽然技巧比较简单，但被同行业的专业人士所赞赏。她想不起他的名字了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Arts, sciences, all learning, all professional techniques, are &lt;em>haggyad&lt;/em>, skilled work. They’re all taught at the colleges, and there are no divisions and few specialists. Teachers and students cross and mix fields all the time, and being a famous scholar in one field doesn’t keep you from being a student in another. Skodr is a vev of physiology, writes plays, and is currently studying history with one of the history vevs. Her thinking is informed and lively and fearless. My School on Main could learn from this college. It’s a wonderful place, full of free minds. But only minds of one gender. A hedged freedom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>艺术、科学、所有学问，所有的专业技术都是&amp;quot;技艺高超&amp;quot;的工作。所有的这些都是在学校里教授的，没有区分和专业人员。教师和学生们经常穿越和混合领域，成为一领域的著名学者并不妨碍成为另一领域的学生。斯科德是生理学家，写剧本，在一位历史老师的指导下正在学习历史。她的思维明晰、活跃而无畏。我的主校区可以从这所学院中学到东西。这是一个充满自由思想的绝妙地方。但只有一个性别的思想。有限的自由。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope Kaza has found a secret college or something, some way to fit in at the castle. He’s strong, but these men have trained for years for the games they play. And a lot of the games are violent. The women say don’t worry, we don’t let the men kill each other, we protect them, they’re our treasures. But I’ve seen men carried off with concussions, on the holos of their martial-art fights, where they throw each other around spectacularly. “Only inexperienced fighters get hurt.” Very reassuring. And they wrestle bulls. And in that melee they call the Maingame they break each other’s legs and ankles deliberately. “What’s a hero without a limp?” the women say. Maybe that’s the safe thing to do, get your leg broken so you don’t have to prove you’re a hero any more. But what else might Kaza have to prove?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我希望卡扎已经找到了一个秘密的学院或其他适合他适应城堡的方式。虽然他很坚强，但这些人已经练习多年参加比赛。很多游戏也是暴力的。女人们说不用担心，他们不会让男人互相杀害，他们是我们的宝藏，我们会保护他们。但我看到男人们因为武术战斗而遭受脑震荡，在那些令人惊叹的招式中，他们互相抛掷。&amp;quot;只有经验不足的战士才会受伤&amp;quot;。这非常令人安心。他们甚至与公牛搏斗，在他们称之为Maingame的混战中故意打断对方的腿和脚踝。女人们说&amp;quot;没有瘸子的英雄算什么?&amp;quot; 也许那是保险的方法，让你的腿骨折，这样你就不需要再证明自己是一名英雄。但卡扎还需要证明什么呢？&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I asked Shask to let me know if she ever heard of him being at the Reha fuckery. But Awaga Castle services (that’s their word, the same word they use for their bulls) four towns, so he might get sent to one of the others. But probably not, because men who don’t win at things aren’t allowed to go to the fuckeries. Only the champions. And boys between fifteen and nineteen, the ones the older women call &lt;em>dippida&lt;/em>, baby animals — puppy, kitty, lamby. They use the dippida for pleasure. They only pay for a champion when they go to the fuckery to get pregnant. But Kaza’s thirty-six, he isn’t a puppy or a kitten or a lamb. He’s a man, and this is a terrible place to be a man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我让Shask告诉我，是否听到他在Reha混乱活动中露面。 但是Awaga城堡服务面积很广，涉及四个城镇，所以他可能会被派到其他城镇去。但很可能不会，因为那些输不了比赛的男人是不允许参加混乱活动的，只有那些获胜者才能参加。只有15岁到19岁之间的男孩才能参加，他们是老年妇女所谓的“dippida”，指小动物，比如小狗、小猫或小羊。他们只为卫生间中怀孕付费选择获胜者。但是Kaza已经36岁了，不是小动物，他是个男人，这里对男人来说是一个可怕的地方。
&lt;em>Kaza Agad had been killed; the Lords of Awaga Castle finally disclosed the fact, but not the circumstances. A year later, Merriment radioed her lander and left Seggri for Hain. Her recommendation was to observe and avoid. The Stabiles, however, decided to send another pair of observers; these were both women, Mobiles Alee Iyoo and Zerin Wu. They lived for eight years on Seggri, after the third year as First Mobiles; Iyoo stayed as Ambassador another fifteen years. They made Resehavanar’s Choice as “all the truth slowly.” A limit of two hundred visitors from off world was set. During the next several generations the people of Seggri, becoming accustomed to the alien presence, considered their own options as members of the Ekumen. Proposals for a planetwide referendum on genetic alteration were abandoned, since the men’s vote would be insignificant unless the women’s vote were handicapped. As of the date of this report the Seggri have not undertaken major genetic alteration, though they have learned and applied various repair techniques, which have resulted in a higher proportion of full-term male infants; the gender balance now stands at about 12:1.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>卡扎·阿加德遇害了，阿瓦加城的领主们最终透露了这一事实，但没有透露具体情况。一年后，梅里门特通过她的登陆器并离开塞格里前往海恩。她的建议是观察和避免。但斯塔比尔决定派另一对观察者；这两位都是女性，移动体阿莉·伊尤和泽林·吴。她们在塞格里生活了八年，其中三年后成为第一移动体；伊尤留任大使，又多待了十五年。她们做出了蕾塞哈瓦纳的选择：“慢慢揭示全部真相”。设定了来自外星的200名访问者的限制。经过几代人的努力，塞格里的居民习惯了异种族的存在，考虑了作为Ekumen成员的自身选项。关于基因改变的全球公投的提议被放弃，因为男性的投票无关重要，除非女性的投票受到限制。截至本报告日期，塞格里人没有进行重大的基因改变，尽管他们已经学会并应用了各种修复技术，这使得出生的男婴比例更高；性别比例现在约为12：1。
&lt;em>The following is a memoir given to Ambassador Eritho te Ves in 93/1569 by a woman in Ush on Seggri.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>以下是乌希的一个女人在塞格里给Eritho te Ves大使于93/1569年提供的回忆录。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You asked me, dear friend, to tell you anything I might like people on other worlds to know about my life and my world. That’s not easy! Do I want anybody anywhere else to know anything about my life? I know how strange we seem to all the others, the half-and-half races; I know they think us backward, provincial, even perverse. Maybe in a few more decades we’ll decide that we should remake ourselves. I won’t be alive then; I don’t think I’d want to be. I like my people. I like our fierce, proud, beautiful men, I don’t want them to become like women. I like our trustful, powerful, generous women, I don’t want them to become like men. And yet I see that among you each man has his own being and nature, each woman has hers, and I can hardly say what it is I think we would lose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>亲爱的朋友，你让我说说我想让其他世界的人们了解我的生活和世界的任何事情，这不容易！我真的希望其他地方的任何人了解我的生活吗？我知道我们看起来多么奇怪，那些混血种族都这么认为；我知道他们认为我们落后、局限、甚至是变态。也许再过几十年，我们会决定我们应该重新塑造自己。那时候我已死去，我不觉得我会想活过来。我喜欢我的族人。我喜欢我们凶猛、自豪、美丽的男人，我不想他们变得像女人。我喜欢我们信任、强大、慷慨的女性，我不想她们变得像男人。然而，我看到你们每个男人有自己的存在和本质，每个女人都有她们的，我几乎无法说出我认为我们会失去什么。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was a child I had a brother a year and a half younger than me. His name was Ittu. My mother had gone to the city and paid five years’ savings for my sire, a Master Champion in the Dancing. Ittu’s sire was an old fellow at our village fuckery; they called him “Master Fallback.” He’d never been a champion at anything, hadn’t sired a child for years, and was only too glad to fuck for free. My mother always laughed about it — she was still suckling me, she didn’t even use a preventive, and she tipped him two coppers! When she found herself pregnant she was furious. When they tested and found it was a male fetus she was even more disgusted at having, as they say, to wait for the miscarriage. But when Ittu was born sound and healthy, she gave the old sire two hundred coppers, all the cash she had.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我小时候有一个比我小一岁半的弟弟叫伊图。我母亲去城里，用她五年的积蓄，买下了我的父亲，一位跳舞大师冠军。伊图的父亲是我们村妓院里的一个老家伙，他们叫他“倒霉蛋大师”。他从来没有在任何事情上获得过冠军，多年来也没有生育，很乐意免费做爱。我母亲总是笑着说 - 她还在哺乳我，她甚至没有使用预防措施，只给了他两个铜板！当她发现自己怀孕时，她很生气。当检查出胎儿是男性时，她更加厌恶等待流产。但当伊图出生健康时，她付给了那个老家伙两百个铜板，这是她所有的现金。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He wasn’t delicate like so many boy babies, but how can you keep from protecting and cherishing a boy? I don’t remember when I wasn’t looking after Ittu, with it all very clear in my head what Little Brother should do and shouldn’t do and all the perils I must keep him from. I was proud of my responsibility, and vain, too, because I had a brother to look after. Not one other motherhouse in my village had a son still living at home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他不像许多男婴一样娇小玲珑，但你怎么能不保护和珍爱一个男孩呢？我记不得我照顾Ittu的时候是从什么时候开始的，我非常清楚小兄弟应该做什么和不该做什么，我必须保护他免受所有的危险。我为自己的责任感感到自豪，并自以为是，因为我有一个弟弟要照顾。在我村的其他母亲家中没有一个有一个儿子还住在家里。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ittu was a lovely child, a star. He had the fleecy soft hair that’s common in my part of Ush, and big eyes; his nature was sweet and cheerful, and he was very bright. The other children loved him and always wanted to play with him, but he and I were happiest playing by ourselves, long elaborate games of make-believe. We had a herd of twelve cattle an old woman of the village had carved from gourd-shell for Ittu — people always gave him presents — and they were the actors in our dearest game. Our cattle lived in a country called Shush, where they had great adventures, climbing mountains, discovering new lands, sailing on rivers, and so on. Like any herd, like our village herd, the old cows were the leaders; the bull lived apart; the other males were gelded; and the heifers were the adventurers. Our bull would make ceremonial visits to service the cows, and then he might have to go fight with men at Shush Castle. We made the castle of clay and the men of sticks, and the bull always won, knocking the stick-men to pieces. Then sometimes he knocked the castle to pieces too. But the best of our stories were told with two of the heifers. Mine was named Op and my brother’s was Utti. Once our hero heifers were having a great adventure on the stream that runs past our village, and their boat got away from us. We found it caught against a log far downstream where the stream was deep and quick. My heifer was still in it. We both dived and dived, but we never found Utti. She had drowned. The Cattle of Shush had a great funeral for her, and Ittu cried very bitterly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>艾图是一个可爱的孩子，一个明星。他有着我乌什的一部分常见的绒毛般柔软的头发和大眼睛；他的个性甜美而开朗，非常聪明。其他孩子们都喜欢他并且总是想和他一起玩，但是他和我在长长的、复杂的想象游戏里玩得最开心了。我们有一个由村里的一位老妇人雕刻成的，共十二头牛组成的牧群，它们是供艾图玩耍的——人们总是送他礼物——在我们最喜欢的游戏中扮演角色。我们的牛群居住在名叫舒什的国家里，在那里它们开展了一系列精彩的冒险：攀登山顶，探索新的土地，顺流而下航行，等等。和任何一只牛群一样，和我们村里的一样，那些老母牛是领导者；雄性牛单独生活；其他公牛都被阉掉了；小母牛们则是冒险家。我们的公牛会进行典礼性的拜访，为母牛服务，之后他可能还要去舒什城和人们战斗。我们用黏土制作了城堡和木棒制作的人物，公牛总是赢了，将木人打得粉碎。有时他也把城堡打得粉碎。但我们最精彩的故事都是和两只小母牛一起讲述的。我的叫做奥普，我的弟弟的是乌提。有一次，我们的英雄小母牛在我们村子旁边的一条小溪上进行了一次伟大的冒险，他们的小船被冲走了。我们发现它卡在下游一根原木上，流水湍急。我的小母牛还在里面。我们俩都潜了下去，可我们始终没有找到乌提。她已经溺水了。舒什牛群为她举行了隆重的葬礼，艾图哭得很伤心。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He mourned his brave little toy cow so long that I asked Djerdji the cattleherd if we could work for her, because I thought being with the real cattle might cheer Ittu up. She was glad to get two cowhands for free (when Mother found out we were really working, she made Djerdji pay us a quarter-copper a day). We rode two big, goodnatured old cows, on saddles so big Ittu could lie down on his. We took a herd of two-year-old calves out onto the desert every day to forage for the &lt;em>edta&lt;/em> that grows best when it’s grazed. We were supposed to keep them from wandering off and from trampling streambanks, and when they wanted to settle down and chew the cud we were supposed to gather them in a place where their droppings would nourish useful plants. Our old mounts did most of the work. Mother came out and checked on what we were doing and decided it was all right, and being out in the desert all day was certainly keeping us fit and healthy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他非常悲痛他勇敢的小玩具牛，我问了牛倌杰尔吉是否可以为她工作，因为我觉得和真正的牛在一起可能会让伊图高兴起来。她很高兴能免费得到两个牧牛人（当母亲知道我们真的在工作时，她让杰尔吉每天支付我们一枚铜硬币的1/4）。我们骑着两只老牛，在马鞍上，伊图可以趴着。每天我们带着一群两岁大的小牛出去寻找生长最好的&lt;em>edta&lt;/em>。我们的任务是防止它们走远，避免践踏溪岸，当它们想要安静地嚼食时，我们应该把它们聚集在一个有益植物营养的地方。我们的老牛承担了大部分工作。母亲出来检查了我们做的事情，认为这样做是可以的，而且整天呆在沙漠中肯定让我们保持健康和适应。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We loved our riding cows, but they were serious-minded and responsible, rather like the grown-ups in our motherhouse. The calves were something else; they were all riding breed, not fine animals of course, just villagebred; but living on edta they were fat and had plenty of spirit. Ittu and I rode them bareback with a rope rein. At first we always ended up on our own backs watching a calf’s heels and tail flying off. By the end of a year we were good riders, and took to training our mounts to tricks, trading mounts at a full run, and hornvaulting. Ittu was a marvelous hornvaulter. He trained a big three-year-old roan ox with lyre horns, and the two of them danced like the finest vaulters of the great castles that we saw on the holos. We couldn’t keep our excellence to ourselves out in the desert; we started showing off to the other children, inviting them to come out to Salt Springs to see our Great Trick Riding Show. And so of course the adults got to hear of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我们喜欢我们的骑牛，但它们非常认真和负责，有点像我们母院里的成年人。小牛则不同，它们都是骑用品种，当然不是很好的动物，只是村里养殖的；但生活在肥沃土地上，小牛又胖又有活力。伊图和我用绳子当缰绳，赤膊骑在它们身上。起初我们总是会摔倒在地，看着小牛的蹄子和尾巴飞起来。但到了一年结束时，我们已经成为了优秀的骑手，并开始训练我们的牛和做些特技，比如在全速奔跑时交换坐骑和角度骑跃等等。伊图擅长角度骑跃，他训练了一头大的三岁红毛牛，样子像筝琴，他们俩就像我们在影像幻灯片里见过的伟大城堡的最好的骑跃者一样跳舞。我们不能将我们在沙漠中的精湛技艺当成秘密，于是开始向其他孩子炫耀，并邀请他们来盐泉看我们的特技骑行表演。因此，大人们自然听说了这件事。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mother was a brave woman, but that was too much for even her, and she said to me in cold fury, “I trusted you to look after Ittu. You let me down.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我的母亲曾经是一位勇敢的女性，但是那件事情甚至让她也无法承受，她冷静地愤怒地对我说：“我信任你能够照顾好伊图，但是你让我失望了。”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the others had been going on and on about endangering the precious life of a boy, the Vial of Hope, the Treasurehouse of Life, and so on, but it was what my mother said that hurt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>其他人都在说要危及一个男孩的宝贵生命、希望之瓶、生命之宝库等等，但是我母亲说的话伤到了我。
“I do look after Ittu, and he looks after me,” I said to her, in that passion of justice that children know, the birthright we seldom honor. “We both know what’s dangerous and we don’t do stupid things and we know our cattle and we do everything together. When he has to go to the castle he’ll have to do lots more dangerous things, but at least he’ll already know how to do one of them. And there he has to do them alone, but we did everything together. And I didn’t let you down.”
“我确实照顾伊图，并且他也照顾我，”我向她说道，带着孩子们所懂的那种公正之情，这宝贵的本性常常被我们忽视。“我们都知道什么是危险的，我们不做蠢事，我们了解我们的牛群，我们一起做所有的事情。当他不得不去城堡时，他将不得不做更多危险的事情，但他至少已经知道了如何做其中一项。在那里，他必须独自完成这些任务，但我们一起做了所有的事情。而我没有让你失望。”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mother looked at us. I was nearly twelve, Ittu was ten. She burst into tears, she sat down on the dirt and wept aloud. Ittu and I both went to her and hugged her and cried. Ittu said, “I won’t go. I won’t go to the damned castle. They can’t make me!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我母亲看着我们，那时我将近十二岁，伊图只有十岁。她哭起来，在土地上坐下来放声大哭。伊图和我都走到她面前，拥抱她，一起哭泣。伊图说：“我不走。我不去那该死的城堡。他们不能逼我！”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I believed him. He believed himself. My mother knew better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我相信了他。他相信自己。我妈妈知道得更清楚。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe some day it will be possible for a boy to choose his life. Among your peoples a man’s body does not shape his fate, does it? Maybe some day that will be so here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>也许有一天，一个男孩可以选择他的生活。在你们的族群，一个人的身体并没有决定他的命运，是吗？也许有一天，在这里也会这样。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our Castle, Hidjegga, had of course been keeping their eye on Ittu ever since he was born; once a year Mother would send them the doctor’s report on him, and when he was five Mother and her wives took him out there for the ceremony of Confirmation. Ittu had been embarrassed, disgusted, and flattered. He told me in secret, “There were all these old &lt;em>men&lt;/em> that smelled funny and they made me take off my clothes and they had these measuring things and they measured my peepee! And they said it was very good. They said it was a good one. What happens when you descend?” It wasn’t the first question he had ever asked me that I couldn’t answer, and as usual I made up the answer. “Descend means you can have babies,” I said, which, in a way, wasn’t so far off the mark.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我们的城堡，希德杰加，自伊图出生后就一直关注着他。每年母亲都会将医生的报告发送给他们，当他五岁时，母亲和其他太太们带他去参加确认仪式。伊图感到尴尬、恶心和受宠若惊。他私下告诉我，“那里有很多气味难闻的老&lt;em>男&lt;/em>人，他们让我脱光衣服，然后拿着一个器具测量我的阳具大小！他们说我的很好，很有用。那么当你退役后会发生什么？”这不是他第一个我回答不出来的问题了，像往常一样，我编了个答案，“退役意味着你可以生孩子，”我说道，某种程度上，这也不算太离谱。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some castles, I am told, prepare boys of nine and ten for the Severance, woo them with visits from older boys, tickets to games, tours of the park and the buildings, so that they may be quite eager to go to the castle when they turn eleven. But we “outyonders,” villagers of the edge of the desert, kept to the harsh old-fashioned ways. Aside from Confirmation, a boy had no contact at all with men until his eleventh birthday. On that day everybody he had ever known brought him to the Gate and gave him to the strangers with whom he would live the rest of his life. Men and women alike believed and still believe that this absolute severance makes the man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>据说，有一些城堡会为九、十岁的男孩准备“离别礼”，邀请年长的男孩来访，赠送比赛门票，参观公园和建筑，让他们在十一岁那年渴望去城堡。但我们这些“远方人”，生活在沙漠边缘的村民，坚持旧的、严苛的方式。除了圣餐会，一个男孩在他十一岁之前完全没有与成年男子接触。在那天，他所认识的所有人都会带他来到门口，将他交给陌生人，他将在那里度过余生。男女都相信，并且仍然相信，这种绝对的离别会造就男子汉。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vev Ushiggi, who had borne a son and had a grandson, and had been mayor five or six times, and was held in great esteem even though she’d never had much money, heard Ittu say that he wouldn’t go to the damned Castle. She came next day to our motherhouse and asked to talk to him. He told me what she said. She didn’t do any wooing or sweetening. She told him that he was born to the service of his people and had one responsibility, to sire children when he got old enough; and one duty, to be a strong, brave man, stronger and braver than other men, so that women would choose him to sire their children. She said he had to live in the Castle because men could not live among women. At this, Ittu asked her, “Why can’t they?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>韦夫·乌什吉，曾当选市长五六次，即便她从来没有太多的财富，但她一直受人尊敬，她生了一个儿子和一个孙子。听到伊图说他不会去那该死的城堡，她来到我们的母堂，要求跟他谈话。他告诉了我她说的话。她没有什么花言巧语。她告诉他他出生在为人民服务的使命之中，并且有一个责任——成年后生育子女;还有一个责任——成为一个比其他男人更强壮、更勇敢的男人，以便女人们选择他作为他们的孩子的父亲。她说他必须住在城堡里，因为男人不能生活在女人中间。听到这些话，伊图问她：“为什么他们不能呢？”
“You did?” I said, awed by his courage, for Vev Ushiggi was a formidable old woman.
“你真的做到了？”我说，对他的勇气感到敬畏，因为Vev Ushiggi是一位令人生畏的老妇人。
“Yes. And she didn’t really answer. She took a long time. She looked at me and then she looked off somewhere and then she stared at me for a long time and then finally she said, ‘Because we would destroy them.’ ”
“是的。她没真的回答。她花了很长时间。她先看着我，然后看向别处，接着又盯着我看了很久，最后她说：‘因为我们会毁掉它们。’”
“But that’s crazy,” I said. “Men are our treasures. What did she say that for?”
“这太疯狂了，”我说。“男人是我们的财富。她为什么要这么说？”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ittu, of course, didn’t know. But he thought hard about what she had said, and I think nothing she could have said would have so impressed him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>伊图当然不知道。但是他认真思考了她说的话，我想没有什么话比这更让他印象深刻了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After discussion, the village elders and my mother and her wives decided that Ittu could go on practicing hornvaulting, because it really would be a useful skill for him in the Castle; but he could not herd cattle any longer, nor go with me when I did, nor join in any of the work children of the village did, nor their games. “You’ve done everything together with Po,” they told him, “but she should be doing things together with the other girls, and you should be doing things by yourself, the way men do.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>经过讨论，村长和我妈妈和她的妻子们决定让伊图继续练习跳跨栏，因为这确实是他在城堡里非常有用的技能；但他不能再放牛，也不能再和我一起放牛，不能参加村里孩子们的任何工作或游戏。“你们已经一起做了所有的事情，”他们告诉他，“但她应该和其他女孩一起做事，而你应该自己做事，男人就是这样做的。”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They were always very kind to Ittu, but they were stern with us girls; if they saw us even talking with Ittu they’d tell us to go on about our work, leave the boy alone. When we disobeyed — when Ittu and I sneaked off and met at Salt Springs to ride together, or just hid out in our old playplace down in the draw by the stream to talk — he got treated with cold silence to shame him, but I got punished. A day locked in the cellar of the old fiber-processing mill, which was what my village used for a jail; next time it was two days; and the third time they caught us alone together, they locked me in that cellar for ten days. A young woman called Fersk brought me food once a day and made sure I had enough water and wasn’t sick, but she didn’t speak; that’s how they always used to punish people in the villages. I could hear the other children going by up on the street in the evening. It would get dark at last and I could sleep. All day I had nothing to do, no work, nothing to think about except the scorn and contempt they held me in for betraying their trust, and the injustice of my getting punished when Ittu didn’t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他们总是对伊图很好，但对我们女孩很严厉；如果他们看见我们甚至跟伊图谈话，就会要求我们继续工作，离开那个男孩。当我们违抗规定 - 当伊图和我悄悄溜走，在Salt Springs见面骑车或者只是躲在流域旧游戏场所聊天 - 他会受到冷漠和无声的惩罚，而我会被惩罚。第一次被关在旧纤维加工厂的地窖里，那是我们村庄用来当做监狱的地方；第二次是两天；而当他们第三次意识到我们俩单独在一起，他们把我锁在地窖里整整十天。一个名叫Fersk的年轻女子每天会给我送来食物并确保我有足够的水和没有生病，但她不会说话；那就是他们在村庄里惯用的惩罚方式。在晚上，我可以听到其他孩子在街上走过。黑夜最终降临，我就可以睡觉了。整天除了思考他们对我投以的鄙视和轻蔑，以及在伊图没有被惩罚时我被处罚的不公正之外，我没有其他事情可做。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I came out, I felt different. I felt like something had closed up inside me while I was closed up in that cellar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>当我出来的时候，我感到不同了。我感觉好像在那个地窖里被关闭起来的时候有什么东西也关闭了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we ate at the motherhouse they made sure Ittu and I didn’t sit near each other. For a while we didn’t even talk to each other. I went back to school and work. I didn’t know what Ittu was doing all day. I didn’t think about it. It was only fifty days to his birthday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>当我们在母院用餐时，他们确保我和伊图不会坐在一起。有一段时间我们甚至不和彼此交谈。我回到学校和工作中。我不知道伊图整天在干什么。我没有考虑过。距离他的生日只有五十天了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One night I got into bed and found a note under my clay pillow: &lt;em>in the draw to-nt&lt;/em>. Ittu never could spell; what writing he knew I had taught him in secret. I was frightened and angry, but I waited an hour till everybody was asleep, and got up and crept outside into the windy, starry night, and ran to the draw. It was late in the dry season and the stream was barely running. Ittu was there, hunched up with his arms round his knees, a little lump of shadow on the pale, cracked clay at the waterside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>有一个晚上，当我爬上床发现我的黏土枕头下有一张纸条：“在抽屉里to-nt”。伊图从来不会拼写，所有的书写技巧都是我暗地里教给他的。我感到害怕和愤怒，但我等了一个小时，直到每个人都睡着了，爬起来悄悄地走出房子，跑到抽屉。干季已经很晚了，小溪几乎没有流水。伊图蜷缩着，双臂环抱着膝盖，在那里，他像是一个小小的阴影块，悄然静静地坐在苍白的、开裂的河滩上。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing I said was, “You want to get me locked up again? They said next time it would be thirty days!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我说的第一件事是：“你想让我再次被关起来吗？他们说下次将是30天！”
“They’re going to lock me up for fifty years,” Ittu said, not looking at me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>伊图说：“他们要把我关五十年的牢。”他没有看我。
“What am I supposed to do about it? It’s the way it has to be! You’re a man. You have to do what men do. They won’t lock you up, anyway, you get to play games and come to town to do service and all that. You don’t even know what being locked up is!”
“我该怎么办呢？这就是它必须的方式！你是一个男人。你必须做男人该做的事情。他们不会锁你起来，反正你可以玩游戏，来城里接受服务等等。你甚至不知道被关起来是什么感觉！”
“I want to go to Seradda,” Ittu said, talking very fast, his eyes shining as he looked up at me. “We could take the riding cows to the bus station in Redang, I saved my money, I have twenty-three coppers, we could take the bus to Seradda. The cows would come back home if we turned them loose.”
“我想去塞拉达”，伊图说，说得非常快，他望着我，眼中闪烁着光。 “我们可以骑牛到热当的巴士站，我攒了钱，有23个铜板，我们可以坐巴士去塞拉达。如果我们放它们走，牛会回家的。”
“What do you think you’d do in Seradda?” I asked, disdainful but curious. Nobody from our village had ever been to the capital.
“你认为你会在塞拉达做什么？”我问道，不屑却好奇。我们村庄的人从来没有去过首都。
“The Ekkamen people are there,” he said.
“埃卡门人在那里，”他说道。
“The Ekumen,” I corrected him. “So what?”
“埃库门”，我纠正他说道。“有什么问题吗？”
“They could take me away,” Ittu said.
“他们可以把我带走，&amp;quot;Ittu说。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I felt very strange when he said that. I was still angry and still disdainful but a sorrow was rising in me like dark water. “Why would they do that? What would they talk to some little boy for? How would you find them? Twenty-three coppers isn’t enough anyway. Seradda’s way far off. That’s a really stupid idea. You can’t do that.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他说那话时，我感到很奇怪。我仍然很生气，仍然很轻蔑，但一种悲伤像黑暗的水一样在我内心升腾。 &amp;quot;他们为什么那样做？他们会和一个小男孩谈些什么？你怎么找到他们？23个铜板根本不够。塞拉达太远了。那真是个愚蠢的主意。你做不到那样做的。&amp;quot;
“I thought you’d come with me,” Ittu said. His voice was softer, but didn’t shake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>伊图说：“我以为你会跟我一起来。”他的声音柔和了一些，但没有颤抖。
“I wouldn’t do a stupid thing like that,” I said furiously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我愤怒地说：“我不会做那样愚蠢的事情。”
“All right,” he said. “But you won’t tell. Will you?”
&amp;quot;好的，&amp;quot; 他说。 &amp;quot;但你不会告诉别人。对吗?&amp;quot;
“No, I won’t tell!” I said. “But you can’t run away, Ittu. You can’t. It would be — it would be dishonorable.”
“不，我不说！”我说。“但是伊图，你不能逃跑。你不能这样做，这是无耻的行为。”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time when he answered his voice shook. “I don’t care,” he said. “I don’t care about honor. I want to be free!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>这一次当他回答时，声音有些颤抖。“我不在意，”他说。“我不在意荣誉。我想要自由！”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were both in tears. I sat down by him and we leaned together the way we used to, and cried a while; not long; we weren’t used to crying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我们俩都哭了起来。我坐到他身边，我们像过去那样搭在一起，哭了一会儿；不算太久；我们不习惯哭泣。
“You can’t do it,” I whispered to him. “It won’t work, Ittu.”
“你做不到的，”我对他低语道。“行不通，伊图。”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He nodded, accepting my wisdom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他点头，接受了我的智慧。
“It won’t be so bad at the Castle,” I said.
“在城堡里应该不会太糟糕，”我说。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a minute he drew away from me very slightly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>过了一分钟后，他稍稍地从我身边离开了一点。
“We’ll see each other,” I said.
“我们会再见面的。”我说道。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He said only, “When?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他只说了一句话：“什么时候？”
“At games. I can watch you. I bet you’ll be the best rider and hornvaulter there. I bet you win all the prizes and get to be a Champion.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>在比赛中，我能看着你。我打赌你会成为最好的骑手和跨栏运动员。我打赌你会赢得所有奖项，并成为冠军。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He nodded, dutiful. He knew and I knew that I had betrayed our love and our birthright of justice. He knew he had no hope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他默然点头，恪守职责。他知道，我知道，我背叛了我们的爱和我们公正的权利。他知道自己毫无希望。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was the last time we talked together alone, and almost the last time we talked together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>那是我们最后一次私下交谈，几乎也是我们最后一次交谈。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ittu ran away about ten days after that, taking the riding cow and heading for Redang; they tracked him easily and had him back in the village before nightfall. I don’t know if he thought I had told them where he would be going. I was so ashamed of not having gone with him that I could not look at him. I kept away from him; they didn’t have to keep me away any more. He made no effort to speak to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>那之后大约十天，伊图带着骑牛逃跑去了红岛；他们很容易地追踪到他，并在日落前把他带回了村里。我不知道他是否认为我告诉了他们他要去哪里。我非常羞愧没有和他一起走，以至于看不向他。我远离他；他们再也不需要把我拦住。他没有试图和我说话。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was beginning my puberty, and my first blood was the night before Ittu’s birthday. Menstruating women are not allowed to come near the Gates at conservative castles like ours, so when Ittu was made a man I stood far back among a few other girls and women, and could not see much of the ceremony. I stood silent while they sang, and looked down at the dirt and my new sandals and my feet in the sandals, and felt the ache and tug of my womb and the secret movement of the blood, and grieved. I knew even then that this grief would be with me all my life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我正在青春期，而我第一次来月经是在Ittu生日前的那个晚上。像我们这样保守的城堡，女性在经期时是不被允许接近大门的，所以当Ittu成为男子汉时，我和其他几个女孩和女人远远站在后面，看不到典礼的太多场景。他们唱歌时，我保持沉默，低头看着泥土、我的新凉鞋和凉鞋里的脚，感受到子宫的痛和拉扯感以及血液的秘密流动，并感到悲伤。即便是那时，我也知道这份悲伤会伴随我一生。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ittu went in and the Gates closed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>伊图走进去，大门关闭了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He became a Young Champion Hornvaulter, and for two years, when he was eighteen and nineteen, came a few times to service in our village, but I never saw him. One of my friends fucked with him and started to tell me about it, how nice he was, thinking I’d like to hear, but I shut her up and walked away in a blind rage which neither of us understood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他成为了一个年轻的冠军跳高运动员，在他十八、十九岁的时候，曾几次来我们村庄参加比赛，但我从未见过他。我的一个朋友和他上床，开始告诉我这个人有多好，以为我会听到很高兴，但我将她制止并愤怒地离开了，这种盲目的愤怒连我们自己都不理解。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He was traded away to a castle on the east coast when he was twenty. When my daughter was born I wrote him, and several times after that, but he never answered my letters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他20岁时被转移到了东海岸的一个城堡。当我的女儿出生时，我写信给他了，此后还写了几次，但他从未回信。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t know what I’ve told you about my life and my world. I don’t know if it’s what I want you to know. It is what I had to tell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我不知道我曾经跟你说过我生命和世界的事情。我也不知道这是否是我想让你知道的。但这就是我必须要说的。
&lt;em>The following is a short story -written in 93/1586 by a popular writer of the city of Adr, Sem Gridji. The classic literature of Seggri was the narrative poem and the drama. Classical poems and plays were written collaboratively, in the original version and also by re-writers of subsequent generations, usually anonymous. Small value was placed on preserving a “true” text, since the work was seen as an ongoing process. Probably under Ekumenical influence, individual writers in the late sixteenth century began writing short prose narratives, historical and fictional. The genre became popular, particularly in the cities, though it never obtained the immense audience of the great classical epics and plays. Literally everyone knew the plots and many quotations from the epics and plays, from books and holo, and almost every adult woman had seen or participated in a staged performance of several of them. They were one of the principal unifying influences of the Seggrian monoculture. The prose narrative, read in silence, served rather as a device by which the culture might question itself, and a tool for individual moral self-examination. Conservative Seggrian women disapproved of the genre as antagonistic to the intensely cooperative, collaborative structure of their society. Fiction was not included in the curriculum of the literature departments of the colleges, and was often dismissed contemptuously&lt;/em> — “&lt;em>fiction is for men&lt;/em>.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>以下是一篇短篇小说，由阿德尔市的著名作家Sem Gridji在93/1586年写成。塞格里的古典文学是叙事诗和戏剧。古典诗歌和戏剧通常是由原创版本和后代重写者合作创作的，通常是匿名的。由于这项工作被看作是一个不断发展的过程，因此很少有人会将“真实”的文本保留下来。可能是在世界统一影响下，个人作家在16世纪晚期开始写历史和虚构的短篇故事。这种流派变得很受欢迎，尤其流行于城市，尽管它从未获得过伟大的古典史诗和戏剧的广泛听众。几乎所有人都知道史诗和戏剧的情节和许多引用，这些引用来自书籍和全息技术，几乎每个成年女性都曾看过或参加过其中的一些短片表演。它们是塞格里亚文化的主要统一影响之一。默读的散文叙事，更多地是一种让文化自我质疑的工具，以及个人道德自我检查的工具。保守的塞格里女性不赞成这一流派，认为它对他们社会的密切合作和协作者结构产生了敌意。小说并未包括在学院文学系的课程中，并且经常被轻蔑地称为“小说是为男人而写的”。
&lt;em>Sem Gridji published three books of stories. Her bare, blunt style is characteristic of the Seggrian short story.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>塞姬丽发表了三本小说集。她的赤裸、直白的写作风格是塞格利亚短篇小说的特点。
&lt;em>&lt;strong>LOVE OUT OF PLACE by Sem Gridji&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>爱失所&lt;/p>
&lt;p>由Sem Gridji撰写&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azak grew up in a motherhouse in the Downriver Quarter, near the textile mills. She was a bright girl, and her family and neighborhood were proud to gather the money to send her to college. She came back to the city as a starting manager at one of the mills. Azak worked well with other people; she prospered. She had a clear idea of what she wanted to do in the next few years: to find two or three partners with whom to found a daughterhouse and a business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>阿扎克在下游区的母亲家中长大，靠近纺织厂。她是个聪明的女孩，她的家庭和社区很自豪能集资送她去上大学。她作为其中一家工厂的起始经理回到了城市。阿扎克和其他人合作得很好，她繁荣昌盛。她有一个很清晰的计划，希望在未来几年里找到两三个合伙人，成立一个女儿院并创业。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A beautiful woman in the prime of youth, Azak took great pleasure in sex, especially liking intercourse with men. Though she saved money for her plan of founding a business, she also spent a good deal at the fuckery, going there often, sometimes hiring two men at once. She liked to see how they incited each other to prowess beyond what they would have achieved alone, and shamed each other when they failed. She found a flaccid penis very disgusting, and did not hesitate to send away a man who could not penetrate her three or four times an evening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>阿扎克是一个年轻美丽的女人，非常享受性生活，尤其喜欢与男人发生性关系。尽管她存下了一些钱用于创业，但她也花了很多时间在性贸易上，经常去那里，有时一次雇两个男人。她喜欢看到他们如何激励彼此，以实现比独自时更强的表现，并在他们失败时使彼此感到耻辱。她觉得软弱的阴茎非常令人恶心，如果有一个男人一晚上没有能够进入她三四次，她会毫不犹豫地把他送走。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The castle of her district bought a Young Champion at the Southeast Castles Dance Tournament, and soon sent him to the fuckery. Having seen him dance in the finals on the holovision and been captivated by his flowing, graceful style and his beauty, Azak was eager to have him service her. His price was twice that of any other man there, but she did not hesitate to pay it. She found him handsome and amiable, eager and gentle, skillful and compliant. In their first evening they came to orgasm together five times. When she left she gave him a large tip. Within the week she was back, asking for Toddra. The pleasure he gave her was exquisite, and soon she was quite obsessed with him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>她所在地区的城堡在东南城堡舞蹈比赛中买了一位年轻的冠军，并很快把他送到妓院。通过在全息视觉上看到他在决赛中的舞蹈，被他流畅、优美的风格和他的美所吸引的Azak渴望拥有他。他的价格是那里任何其他男人的两倍，但她毫不犹豫地支付了。她觉得他英俊可人、和蔼可亲、急切而温柔、灵巧且顺从。在他们的第一个晚上，他们一起达到五次高潮。当她离开时，她给了他丰厚的小费。不到一周，她又回来了，要求见到托德拉。他带给她的快乐是美妙的，很快她就完全着迷于他。
“I wish I had you all to myself,” she said to him one night as they lay still conjoined, languorous and fulfilled.
“我希望我可以全部拥有你，” 她在一个晚上对他说道，当他们懒散、满足地躺在一起。
“That is my heart’s desire,” he said. “I wish I were your servant. None of the other women that come here arouse me. I don’t want them. I want only you.”
“那是我内心的渴望，”他说。“我希望成为你的仆人。你之外其它来这里的女人都不能引起我的欲望。我不要她们。我只想要你。”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She wondered if he was telling the truth. The next time she came, she inquired casually of the manager if Toddra were as popular as they had hoped. “No,” the manager said. “Everybody else reports that he takes a lot of arousing, and is sullen and careless towards them.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>她想知道他是否在说实话。 下一次她来时，她随便问了经理一句，问他们是否如愿以偿地让托德拉成为了一位受欢迎的人物。 经理回答说：“不，所有其他人都报告说他需要很多刺激才能勃起，并且对他们很脾气暴躁和不负责任。”
“How strange,” Azak said.
&amp;quot;很奇怪,&amp;quot; Azak 说道。
“Not at all,” said the manager. “He’s in love with you.”
“不是的，”经理说。“他爱上你了。”
“A man in love with a woman?” Azak said, and laughed.
&amp;quot;爱上女人的男人？&amp;quot; Azak说着，笑了。
“It happens all too often,” the manager said.
“这种情况经常发生，”经理说道。
“I thought only women fell in love,” said Azak.
&amp;quot;我以为只有女人会恋爱,&amp;quot; Azak说道。&amp;quot;
“Women fall in love with a man, sometimes, and that’s bad too,” said the manager. “May I warn you, Azak? Love should be between women. It’s out of place here. It can never come to any good end. I hate to lose the money, but I wish you’d fuck with some of the other men and not always ask for Toddra. You’re encouraging him, you see, in something that does harm to him.”
“女人有时会爱上男人，这也是不好的，”经理说，“阿扎克，我可以警告你。爱应该是女人之间的。在这里它是不合适的。这永远不会有一个好的结果。我不想失去这笔钱，但我希望你能和其他男人上床，而不是总是找托德拉。你在鼓励他做对他有害的事情。”
“But he and you are making lots of money from me!” said Azak, still taking it as a joke.
“可是他和你们都在用我赚很多钱啊！”阿扎克还是认为这是个玩笑。
“He’d make more from other women if he wasn’t in love with you,” said the manager. To Azak that seemed a weak argument against the pleasure she had in Toddra, and she said, “Well, he can fuck them all when I’ve done with him, but for now, I want him.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>经理说：“如果他不爱你，他可以从其他女人那儿得到更多的好处。”对于阿扎克来说，这似乎是一种对托德拉带来快乐的弱势论据，她说：“好吧，当我玩腻了他时，他可以和所有女人做爱，但现在，我需要他。”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After their intercourse that evening, she said to Toddra, “The manager here says you’re in love with me.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>那晚他们做完爱之后，她对托德拉说：“经理告诉我你爱上了我。”
“I told you I was,” Toddra said. “I told you I wanted to belong to you, to serve you, you alone. I would die for you, Azak.”
“我告诉过你了，”托德拉说。“我告诉过你我想属于你，为你服务，只为你服务。我愿意为你而死，阿扎克。”
“That’s foolish,” she said.
&amp;quot;那是愚蠢的,&amp;quot;她说。
“Don’t you like me? Don’t I please you?”
“你不喜欢我吗？我不讨你喜欢吗？”
“More than any man I ever knew,” she said, kissing him. “You are beautiful and utterly satisfying, my sweet Toddra.”
“比我认识的任何人都要多，”她亲吻他说。“你是美丽而完美的，我甜美的托德拉。”
“You don’t want any of the other men here, do you?” he asked.
“你不会想要这里的其他任何男人，对吧？”他问道。
“No. They’re all ugly fumblers, compared to my beautiful dancer.”
“不。相比我的美丽舞者，他们都是笨拙丑陋的。”
“Listen, then,” he said, sitting up and speaking very seriously. He was a slender man of twenty-two, with long, smooth-muscled limbs, wide-set eyes, and a thin-lipped, sensitive mouth. Azak lay stroking his thigh, thinking how lovely and lovable he was. “I have a plan,” he said. “When I dance, you know, in the story-dances, I play a woman, of course; I’ve done it since I was twelve. People always say they can’t believe I really am a man, I play a woman so well. If I escaped — from here, from the Castle — as a woman — I could come to your house as a servant — ”
“听我说，”他坐了起来，非常严肃地说道。他是个22岁的瘦长男子，有着长长的、光滑的肌肉，宽大的眼睛，和一张薄唇、敏感的嘴巴。阿扎克躺在那里抚摸着自己的大腿，想着他是多么美丽可爱。“我有一个计划。”他说，“当我跳舞的时候，你知道，在故事舞蹈中，我扮演的都是女人；我从十二岁开始这样做。人们总是说，他们无法相信我是个男人，我扮演女人做得如此出色。如果我——作为一个女人——逃离——从这里、从城堡——我可以作为女仆来到你的家里——”
“What?” cried Azak, astounded.“I could live there,” he said urgently, bending over her. “With you. I would always be there. You could have me every night. It would cost you nothing, except my food. I would serve you, service you, sweep your house, do anything, anything, Azak, please, my beloved, my mistress, let me be yours!” He saw that she was still incredulous, and hurried on, “You could send me away when you got tired of me — ”“If you tried to go back to the Castle after an escapade like that they’d whip you to death, you idiot!”“I’m valuable,” he said. “They’d punish me, but they wouldn’t damage me.”“You’re wrong. You haven’t been dancing, and your value here has slipped because you don’t perform well with anybody but me. The manager told me so.”Tears stood in Toddra’s eyes. Azak disliked giving him pain, but she was genuinely shocked at his wild plan. “And if you were discovered, my dear,” she said more gently, “I would be utterly disgraced. It is a very childish plan, Toddra. Please never dream of such a thing again. But I am truly, truly fond of you, I adore you and want no other man but you. Do you believe that, Toddra?”He nodded. Restraining his tears, he said, “For now.”“For now and for a long, long, long time! My dear, sweet, beautiful dancer, we have each other as long as we want, years and years! Only do your duty by the other women that come, so that you don’t get sold away by your Castle, please! I couldn’t bear to lose you, Toddra.” And she clasped him passionately in her arms, and arousing him at once, opened to him, and soon both were crying out in the throes of delight.Though she could not take his love entirely seriously, since what could come of such a misplaced emotion, except such foolish schemes as he had proposed? — still he touched her heart, and she felt a tenderness towards him that greatly enhanced the pleasure of their intercourse. So for more than a year she spent two or three nights a week with him at the fuckery, which was as much as she could afford. The manager, trying still to discourage his love, would not lower Toddra’s fee, even though he was unpopular among the other clients of the fuckery; so Azak spent a great deal of money on him, although he would never, after the first night, accept a tip from her.Then a woman who had not been able to conceive with any of the sires at the fuckery tried Toddra, and at once conceived, and being tested found the fetus to be male. Another woman conceived by him, again a male fetus. At once Toddra was in demand as a sire. Women began coming from all over the city to be serviced by him. This meant, of course, that he must be free during their period of ovulation. There were now many evenings that he could not meet Azak, for the manager was not to be bribed. Toddra disliked his popularity, but Azak soothed and reassured him, telling him how proud she was of him, and how his work would never interfere with their love. In fact, she was not altogether sorry that he was so much in demand, for she had found another person with whom she wanted to spend her evenings.This was a young woman named Zedr, who worked in the mill as a machine-repair specialist. She was tall and handsome; Azak noticed first how freely and strongly she walked and how proudly she stood. She found a pretext to make her acquaintance. It seemed to Azak that Zedr admired her; but for a long time each behaved to the other as a friend only, making no sexual advances. They were much in each other’s company, going to games and dances together, and Azak found that she enjoyed this open and sociable life better than always being in the fuckery alone with Toddra. They talked about how they might set up a machine-repair service in partnership. As time went on, Azak found that Zedr’s beautiful body was always in her thoughts. At last, one evening in her singlewoman’s flat, she told her friend that she loved her, but did not wish to burden their friendship with an unwelcome desire.Zedr replied, “I have wanted you ever since I first saw you, but I didn’t want to embarrass you with my desire. I thought you preferred men.”“Until now I did, but I want to make love with you,” Azak said.She found herself quite timid at first, but Zedr was expert and subtle, and could prolong Azak’s orgasms till she found such consummation as she had not dreamed of. She said to Zedr, “You have made me a woman.”“Then let’s make each other wives,” said Zedr joyfully.They married, moved to a house in the west of the city, and left the mill, setting up in business together.All this time, Azak had said nothing of her new love to Toddra, whom she had seen less and less often. A little ashamed of her cowardice, she reassured herself that he was so busy performing as a sire that he would not really miss her. After all, despite his romantic talk of love, he was a man, and to a man fucking is the most important thing, instead of being merely one element of love and life as it is to a woman.When she married Zedr, she sent Toddra a letter, saying that their lives had drifted apart, and she was now moving away and would not see him again, but would always remember him fondly.She received an immediate answer from Toddra, a letter begging her to come and talk with him, full of avowals of unchanging love, badly spelled and almost illegible. The letter touched, embarrassed, and shamed her, and she did not answer it.He wrote again and again, and tried to reach her on the holonet at her new business. Zedr urged her not to make any response, saying, “It would be cruel to encourage him.”Their new business went well from the start. They were home one evening busy chopping vegetables for dinner when there was a knock at the door. “Come in,” Zedr called, thinking it was Chochi, a friend they were considering as a third partner. A stranger entered, a tall, beautiful woman with a scarf over her hair. The stranger went straight to Azak, saying in a strangled voice, “Azak, Azak, please, please let me stay with you.” The scarf fell back from his long hair. Azak recognised Toddra.She was astonished and a little frightened, but she had known Toddra a long time and been very fond of him, and this habit of affection made her put out her hands to him in greeting. She saw fear and despair in his face, and was sorry for him.But Zedr, guessing who he was, was both alarmed and angry. She kept the chopping knife in her hand. She slipped from the room and called the city police.When she returned she saw the man pleading with Azak to let him stay hidden in their household as a servant. “I will do anything,” he said. “Please, Azak, my only love, please! I can’t live without you. I can’t service those women, those strangers who only want to be impregnated. I can’t dance any more. I think only of you, you are my only hope. I will be a woman, no one will know. I’ll cut my hair, no one will know!” So he went on, almost threatening in his passion, but pitiful also. Zedr listened coldly, thinking he was mad. Azak listened with pain and shame. “No, no, it is not possible,” she said over and over, but he would not hear.When the police came to the door and he realized who they were, he bolted to the back of the house seeking escape. The policewomen caught him in the bedroom; he fought them desperately, and they subdued him brutally. Azak shouted at them not to hurt him, but they paid no heed, twisting his arms and hitting him about the head till he stopped resisting. They dragged him out. The chief of the troop stayed to take evidence. Azak tried to plead for Toddra, but Zedr stated the facts and added that she thought he was insane and dangerous.
“什么？”阿扎克吃惊地喊道。“我可以住在那里，“他紧急地弯下腰对她说。“跟你在一起，我总是会在那里。你可以每晚都找我。这不需要你花任何钱，除了我的食物。我会为你服务，为你服务，打扫你的房子，做任何事情，任何事情，阿扎克，请，我心爱的，我的女主人，让我成为你的人！”他看到她仍然不敢相信，急忙说道，“当你厌倦我时你可以把我送走——” “如果你像这样逃跑回城堡，他们会把你抽死的，你这个笨蛋！”“我是有价值的，”他说。“他们会惩罚我，但他们不会伤害我。”“你错了。你没有跳过舞蹈，你现在的价值已经降低了，因为除了我以外你没有和任何人表现得很好。经理告诉我的。”托德拉的眼里露出了泪水。阿扎克不喜欢给他疼痛，但她真的被他的疯狂计划震惊了。“如果你被发现了，亲爱的。”她更加温柔地说，“我会彻底地丢脸。这真是个幼稚的计划，托德拉。请不要再做这样的事情。但是我真的、真的喜欢你，我崇拜你，除了你以外我不想要别的男人。你相信吗，托德拉？”他点了点头。他收起眼泪，说：“现在是相信。”“现在以及很久很久很久，亲爱的，甜蜜美丽的舞者，只要我们想要，我们就能在一起好几年！只要你对其他来的女人尽职尽责，这样你就不会被城堡卖掉！我不能失去你，托德拉。”然后她热情地拥抱着他，让他兴奋起来，很快他们俩都在呻吟着。尽管她并不能完全认真地接受他的爱，因为从这样一种错误的观点出发能得到什么，除了他提出的这些愚蠢的计划之外？——尽管如此，她感动了，她对他心存柔情，这大大增强了他们之间的性爱的乐趣。因此，她在这里度过了一年多时间，每周与他在带她无法承受的地方见面两三个晚上，这已经是她所能承受的。经理仍然试图打消他的爱，即使他受到了其他客户在这个可憎的事情上的不受欢迎的影响；因此，阿扎克花了很多钱在他身上，尽管他永远不会接受她的小费。然后一个女人试着和其他人在一起无法怀孕，于是尝试着和托德拉，而马上怀上了，检验后发现胎儿是男性。另一个女人再次怀孕，胎儿也是男性。于是托德拉成为了一位受欢迎的种马。女人们从整个城市赶来找他服务。这当然意味着，在她们排卵期间，他必须自由。现在有许多晚上他不能见到阿扎克，因为经理是不受贿赂的。托德拉讨厌他的受欢迎程度，但阿扎克安慰和安抚他，告诉他她是多么的为他感到骄傲，而且他的工作永远不会干扰他们之间的爱。事实上，她并不完全后悔他这么受欢迎，因为她已经找到另一个人，她想和她度过她的夜晚。这个人是名叫泽德尔的年轻女子，她在厂里担任机械维修专家。她高大威猛。阿扎克首先注意到她自由有力的步伐和她自豪的站姿。她找到了借口和她结识。阿扎克认为泽德尔崇拜她。但是有很长一段时间，他们互相只当做朋友，并没有进行什么性骚扰。他们经常在一起，去看比赛和跳舞，阿扎克发现，她更喜欢这种开放和社交的生活，而不是总是和托德拉在那不好的地方度过。他们谈论如何成立一家机械维修服务公司。随着时间的推移，阿扎克发现，泽德尔美丽的身体总是在她的思维中。最后，在一个晚上，她单身的公寓里，她告诉她的朋友，她爱她，但不希望用一个不受欢迎的欲望压垮他们的友谊。泽德尔回答说：“我从我第一次见到你时就想要你了，但我不想让你为我的欲望感到尴尬。我认为你更喜欢男人。”“直到现在我是这样想的，但是我想和你做爱，”阿扎克说。一开始她感到很羞涩，但是泽德尔很熟练，很微妙，能延长阿扎克的高潮，让她获得她没有想象过的满足。她对泽德尔说：“你让我成为了一个女人。”“那么让我们成为彼此的妻子，”泽德尔高兴地说道。他们结婚了，搬到了城市的西边一个房子里，并离开了工厂，成立了一家合作公司。所有这些时间里，阿扎克没有对托德拉透露她的新爱情，她见他的时间越来越少。她有点为自己的懦弱感到羞耻，但她自欺欺人地认为，在这里忙着当一个种马，他不会真的想念她。毕竟，尽管他有关爱的浪漫言论，他始终还是一个男人，对他来说，性交才是最重要的事，而不是作为一种爱和生命的元素，就像对于一个女人来说一样。当她嫁给泽德尔时，她写了一封信给托德拉，说他们的生活已经分道扬镳，她现在要搬家了，不会再见他了，但会永远怀念他。她立刻收到了托德拉的回信，请求她来跟他谈谈，充满了不变的爱的宣誓，拼写错误，几乎无法辨认。这封信使她感动、尴尬和羞耻，她没有回信。他写了一次又一次的信，试图在她的新公司的holonet上联系她。泽德尔敦促她不要作出任何回应，说：“这样会让他受伤。”他们的新业务从一开始就很好。一天晚上，他们&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After some days, Azak inquired at the police office and was told that Toddra had been returned to his Castle with a warning not to send him to the fuckery again for a year or until the Lords of the Castle found him capable of responsible behavior. She was uneasy thinking of how he might be punished. Zedr said, “They won’t hurt him, he’s too valuable,” just as he himself had said. Azak was glad to believe this. She was, in fact, much relieved to know that he was out of the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>几天后，阿扎克前往警察局询问，并被告知托德拉已被送回城堡，并受到警告，禁止在一年内将他送回那个地方，除非城堡的领主认为他有负责的行为表现。想到他可能会受到惩罚，她感到不安。 泽德尔说：“他们不会伤害他，他太有价值了。”，就像他自己所说的那样。 阿扎克很高兴相信这一点。 她事实上非常放心，知道他已经没事了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She and Zedr took Chochi first into their business and then into their household. Chochi was a woman from the dockside quarter, tough and humorous, a hard worker and an undemanding, comfortable lovemaker. They were happy with one another, and prospered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>她和泽得一起带着乔奇入了他们的生意，然后再带进了他们的家中。乔奇来自码头一带，她坚强有幽默感，是一个勤劳而随和的性伙伴。他们彼此相爱，生活幸福。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A year went by, and another year. Azak went to her old quarter to arrange a contract for repair work with two women from the mill where she had first worked. She asked them about Toddra. He was back at the fuckery from time to time, they told her. He had been named the year’s Champion Sire of his Castle, and was much in demand, bringing an even higher price, because he impregnated so many women and so many of the conceptions were male. He was not in demand for pleasure, they said, as he had a reputation for roughness and even cruelty. Women asked for him only if they wanted to conceive. Thinking of his gentleness with her, Azak found it hard to imagine him behaving brutally. Harsh punishment at the Castle, she thought, must have altered him. But she could not believe that he had truly changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>一年又一年过去了。Azak 去了她旧的地区，与一家磨坊里的两位女士安排了一份维修合同，这是她曾经工作的地方。她问了她们关于 Toddra 的情况。他偶尔回去那个淫乱的地方，她们告诉她。他已经被评为了城堡里当年的“冠军种马”，非常抢手，因为他让许多女人怀孕，而且很多都是男孩。他并不是因为他有残忍和凶暴的声誉而受欢迎的，他们说。女人们只有想怀孕的时候才会找他。想到他曾经的温柔，Azak 觉得很难想象他会变得残忍。她认为，城堡里的严厉惩罚一定改变了他。但是她无法相信他真的变了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another year passed. The business was doing very well, and Azak and Chochi both began talking seriously about having children. Zedr was not interested in bearing, though happy to be a mother.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>又过了一年。生意非常繁荣，阿扎克和乔奇开始认真考虑要孩子的事情。而赛德尔对于生育并不感兴趣，虽然很乐意当个母亲。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chochi had a favorite man at their local fuckery to whom she went now and then for pleasure; she began going to him at ovulation, for he had a good reputation as a sire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chochi在当地的性交场所有个最喜欢的男人，她时不时地去找他寻欢作乐；她开始在排卵期去找他，因为他有一个作为公牛的良好声誉。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azak had not been to a fuckery since she and Zedr married. She honored fidelity highly, and made love with no one but Zedr and Chochi. When she thought of being impregnated, she found that her old interest in fucking with men had quite died out or even turned to distaste. She did not like the idea of self-impregnation from the sperm bank, but the idea of letting a strange man penetrate her was even, more repulsive. Thinking what to do, she thought of Toddra, whom she had truly loved and had pleasure with. He was again a Champion Sire, known throughout the city as a reliable impregnator. There was certainly no other man with whom she could take any pleasure. And he had loved her so much he had put his career and even his life in danger, trying to be with her. That irresponsibility was over and done with. He had never written to her again, and the Castle and the managers of the fuckery would never have let him service women if they thought him mad or untrustworthy. After all this time, she thought, she could go back to him and give him the pleasure he had so desired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>阿扎克结婚后从未去过公共交际场所。她高度重视忠诚，只和泽德尔和乔奇做爱。当她想到自己怀孕的时候，她发现自己对于和男人做爱的旧兴趣已经完全消失甚至变成了厌恶。她不喜欢从精液库进行自我受孕的想法，但是让一个陌生男人渗透她的想法甚至更加令人厌恶。思考着该怎么办，她想到了托德拉，他们曾相爱并且共度美好时光。他再次成为了冠军公牛，在整个城市也以可靠的种犬而闻名。除此之外，她找不到其他男人可以为她带来任何快感。而且他那曾为和她在一起而置生命于不顾的不负责任之举已经结束了。他再也没有写信给她，如果城堡和交际场所的经理认为他疯了或者不可信任的话，他们不会让他为女性提供服务。经过这么长时间，她想，她可以回到他身边，给他他一直渴望的快乐。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She notified the fuckery of the expected period of her next ovulation, requesting Toddra. He was already engaged for that period, and they offered her another sire; but she preferred to wait till the next month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>她通知了Toddra她下一次排卵的预期时间，并请求他成为种子捐献者。他在那个时间段已经有其他捐献任务了，他们提供了另一位种子捐赠者；但是她宁愿等到下个月再进行。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chochi had conceived, and was elated. “Hurry up, hurry up!” she said to Azak. “We want twins!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chochi已经怀孕了，而且非常高兴。“快点，快点！”她对Azak说，“我们想要双胞胎！”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azak found herself looking forward to being with Toddra. Regretting the violence of their last encounter and the pain it must have given him, she wrote the following letter to him:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azak发现自己期待与Toddra在一起。她为他们上次遭遇的暴力和痛苦感到遗憾，写信给他如下：
&lt;em>“My dear, I hope our long separation and the distress of our last meeting will be forgotten in the joy of being together again, and that you still love me as I still love you. I shall be very proud to bear your child, and let us hope it may be a son! I am impatient to see you again, my beautiful dancer. Your Azak.”&lt;/em>
“亲爱的，希望我们长时间的分离和上次相聚时的痛苦在再次相聚的欢乐中被遗忘，也希望你还像我一样爱我。我很骄傲能生育你的孩子，让我们希望它是个儿子！我很急切地想再次见到你，我的美丽舞者。你的 Azak.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There had not been time for him to answer this letter when her ovulation period began. She dressed in her best clothes. Zedr still distrusted Toddra and had tried to dissuade her from going to him; she bade her “Good luck!” rather sulkily. Chochi hung a mother-charm around her neck, and she went off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>当她的排卵期开始时，他还没有时间回信。她穿上最好的衣服，但赛托依然不信任托德拉，并试图劝阻她去见他；她有点皱眉，向她祝福好运。丘奇给她挂上一个母亲护身符，然后她便出发了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was a new manager on duty at the fuckery, a coarse-faced young woman who told her, “Call out if he gives you any trouble. He may be a Champion but he’s rough, and we don’t let him get away with hurting anybody.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>淫秽场所有新的值班经理，一个长得粗鄙的年轻女人告诉她：“如果他给你惹麻烦，就叫喊。他可能是冠军，但他很粗鲁，我们不允许他伤害任何人。”
“He won’t hurt me,” Azak said, smiling, and went eagerly into the familiar room where she and Toddra had enjoyed each other so often. He was standing waiting at the window just as he had used to stand. When he turned he looked just as she remembered, long-limbed, his silky hair flowing like water down his back, his wide-set eyes gazing at her.
“他不会伤害我，”Azak微笑着说道，迫不及待地走进了熟悉的房间，她和Toddra经常在这里互相享受。他站在窗前等待，就像以前一样。当他转过身来时，他看起来就像她记得的那样，四肢修长，他的柔软头发像水流一样垂在他的背上，他宽间距的眼睛凝视着她。
“Toddra!” she said, coming to him with outstretched hands.
“托德拉！”她伸出双手走向他。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He took her hands and said her name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他握住了她的手，喊出了她的名字。
“Did you get my letter? Are you happy?”
&amp;quot;你收到我的信了吗？你开心吗？&amp;quot;
“Yes,” he said, smiling.
“是的”，他微笑着说。
“And all that unhappiness, all that foolishness about love, is it over? I am so sorry you were hurt, Toddra, I don’t want any more of that. Can we just be ourselves and be happy together as we used to be?”
“那些所有的不幸，对爱情的所有傻气，都结束了吗？我很抱歉你受伤了，托德拉，我不想再有这样的事情发生。我们能否像以前一样，只是做自己，并快乐地在一起？”
“Yes, all that is over,” he said. “And I am happy to see you.” He drew her gently to him. Gently he began to undress her and caress her body, just as he had used to, knowing what gave her pleasure, and she remembering what gave him pleasure. They lay down naked together. She was fondling his erect penis, aroused and yet a little reluctant to be penetrated after so long, when he moved his arm as if uncomfortable. Drawing away from him a little, she saw that he had a knife in his hand, which he must have hidden in the bed. He was holding it concealed behind his back.
“是的，一切都结束了。”他说。“我很高兴见到你。”他轻轻地把她拥入怀中。他慢慢地脱下她的衣服，抚摸着她的身体，就像以前一样，知道什么让她感觉舒适，而她也记得什么让他感到愉悦。他们一起赤裸裸地躺下。她抚摸着他勃起的阴茎，既兴奋又有点不愿被插入这么久，当他移动胳膊，仿佛不舒服时。她离他远一点，看到他手里拿着一把刀，肯定是躲在床里隐藏起来的。他把它藏在了他的背后。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her womb went cold, but she continued to fondle his penis and testicles, not daring to say anything and not able to pull away, for he was holding her close with the other hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>她的子宫变得寒冷，但她仍旧继续抚摸着他的阴茎和睾丸，不敢说出任何话语，也无法挣脱，因为他的另一只手紧紧抓住了她。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suddenly he moved onto her and forced his penis into her vagina with a thrust so painful that for an instant she thought it was the knife. He ejaculated instantly. As his body arched she writhed out from under him, scrambled to the door, and ran from the room crying for help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>突然，他向她靠近，并用一股剧烈的冲刺强行将他的阴茎插入她的阴道，疼痛让她瞬间以为是一把刀。他立即射精。当他的身体弓起时，她蠕动着从他的身下挣脱出来，爬到门口，大喊求救从房间里跑开。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He pursued her, striking with the knife, stabbing her in the shoulderblade before the manager and other women and men seized him. The men were very angry and treated him with a violence which the manager’s protests did not lessen. Naked, bloody, and half-conscious, he was bound and taken away immediately to the Castle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他追赶她，挥舞着刀，刺中她的肩胛骨，直到经理和其他女人和男人抓住他才停下。那些男人非常生气，对他采取了暴力行为，经理的抗议并没有减轻他们的愤怒。他赤裸着身体，浑身是血，半昏迷的状态下被捆绑走，并立即被带走到要塞。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everyone now gathered around Azak, and her wound, which was slight, was cleaned and covered. Shaken and confused, she could ask only, “What will they do to him?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>现在所有人都围在Azak周围，她的伤口很轻，被清洗并包扎了起来。她受到惊吓和困惑，只能问道：“他们会对他做什么？”
“What do you think they do to a murdering rapist? Give him a prize?” the manager said. “They’ll geld him.”
“你认为他们会对一个谋杀强奸犯做什么？给他一个奖励吗？”经理说。“他们会阉割他的。”
“But it was my fault,” Azak said.
“但那是我的错，”阿萨克说。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The manager stared at her and said, “Are you mad? Go home.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>经理盯着她说：“你疯了吗？回家去吧。”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She went back into the room and mechanically put on her clothes. She looked at the bed where they had lain. She stood at the window where Toddra had stood. She remembered how she had seen him dance long ago in the contest where he had first been made champion. She thought, “My life is wrong.” But she did not know how to make it right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>她走回房间，机械地穿上衣服。她看着他们曾经躺过的床。她站在 Toddra 曾站过的窗户前。她记得多年前看到他在比赛中跳舞，那时他第一次成为冠军。她想，“我的人生是错误的。”但她不知道如何才能让它变得正确。
&lt;em>Alteration in Seggrian social and cultural institutions did not take the disastrous course Merriment feared. It has been slow and its direction is not clear. In 93/1602 Terhada College invited men from two neighboring castles to apply as students, and three men did so. In the next decades, most colleges opened their doors to men. Once they were graduated, male students had to return to their castle, unless they left the planet, since native men were not allowed to live anywhere but as students in a college or in a castle, until the Open Gate Law was passed in 93/1662.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>塞格里安社会和文化机构的变革并没有采取梅里曼特所担心的灾难性的进程。这一变化过程缓慢，其方向也不明确。在93/1602年，特哈达学院邀请两个邻近城堡的人申请成为学生，其中三人这样做了。在接下来的几十年里，大多数学院向男性开放。一旦他们毕业，男性学生必须回到自己的城堡，除非他们离开这个星球，因为当地男性只被允许住在学院或城堡里，直到93/1662年通过了开放大门法规。
&lt;em>Even after passage of that law, the castles remained closed to women; and the exodus of men from the castles was much slower than opponents of the measure feared. Social adjustment to the Open Gate Law has been slow. In several regions programs to train men in basic skills such as farming and construction have met with moderate success; the men work in competitive teams, separate from and managed by the women’s companies. A good many Seggri have come to Main to study in recent years&lt;/em> — &lt;em>more men than women, despite the great numerical imbalance that still exists&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>即使通过了那项法律，城堡仍然对女性关闭；男性逃离城堡的速度比反对这项措施的人担心的要慢得多。社会对开放门禁法的适应是缓慢的。在几个地区，培训男性基本技能（如耕种和建筑）的计划取得了适度的成功；这些男性在竞争小组中工作，由女性公司管理。近年来，有许多塞格里人来到主城学习*，男性比女性多，尽管目前仍存在巨大的数字失衡问题。
&lt;em>The following autobiographical sketch by one of these men is of particular interest, since he was involved in the event which directly precipitated the Open Gate Law.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>以下这位男子的自传小传格外引人注目，因为他涉及到直接引发开放门户法的事件。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH BY MOBILE ARDAR DEZ&lt;/p>
&lt;p>移动·阿达尔·德兹的自传简介&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was born in Ekumenical Cycle 93, Year 1641, in Rakedr on Seggri. Rakedr was a placid, prosperous, conservative town, and I was brought up in the old way, the petted boychild of a big motherhouse. Altogether there were seventeen of us, not counting the kitchen staff — a great-grandmother, two grandmothers, four mothers, nine daughters, and me. We were well off; all the women were or had been managers or skilled workers in the Rakedr Pottery, the principal industry of the town. We kept all the holidays with pomp and energy, decorating the house from roof to foundation with banners for Hillalli, making fantastic costumes for the Harvest Festival, and celebrating somebody’s birthday every few weeks with gifts all round. I was petted, as I said, but not, I think, spoiled. My birthday was no grander than my sisters’, and I was allowed to run and play with them just as if I were a girl. Yet I was always aware, as were they, that our mothers’ eyes rested on me with a different look, brooding, reserved, and sometimes, as I grew older, desolate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我出生于埃古门纪循环93年，1641年，位于赛格里的拉克德尔。拉克德尔是一个宁静、繁荣、保守的小镇。我在旧有的方式下长大，是一位受宠爱的男孩，属于一个庞大的母亲之家。我们家共有17个人，不包括厨房人员，包括一个曾祖母、两个祖母、四个母亲、九个女儿和我。我们生活富足；所有的女性都是拉克德尔陶瓷公司的经理或熟练工人。我们以盛大的气氛庆祝所有的节日，为希拉里节从屋顶到地基悬挂彩旗，在收获节上制作奇异的服装，并每隔几周为某人的生日送上礼物。我如我所说受到宠爱，但我想没有被溺爱。我的生日没有比我的姐妹们的盛大，我也被允许跟她们一样奔跑游戏，仿佛我是一个女孩。然而，随着时间的推移，我和她们一样时刻注意到，我们母亲的目光落在我身上时是不同的，沉思、冷静、有时甚至绝望。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After my Confirmation, my birthmother or her mother took me to Rakedr Castle every spring on Visiting Day. The gates of the park, which had opened to admit me alone (and terrified) for my Confirmation, remained shut, but rolling stairs were placed against the park walls. Up these I and a few other little boys from the town climbed, to sit on top of the park wall in great state, on cushions, under awnings, and watch demonstration dancing, bull-dancing, wrestling, and other sports on the great gamefield inside the wall. Our mothers waited below, outside, in the bleachers of the public field. Men and youths from the Castle sat with us, explaining the rules of the games and pointing out the fine points of a dancer or wrestler, treating us seriously, making us feel important. I enjoyed that very much, but as soon as I came down off the wall and started home it all fell away like a costume shrugged off, a part played in a play; and I went on with my work and play in the motherhouse with my family, my real life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我的Confirmation之后，我的亲生母亲或她的母亲每年春天都会带我去拜访日的Rakedr城堡。公园的门曾经为了让我独自进入（且惊恐不安），而打开过，但现在已经紧闭，而是在园墙边放置了滚动梯子。我和城镇里的一些小男孩都沿着梯子爬了上去，在墙顶上坐在垫子上，在帷篷下欣赏示范舞蹈、斗牛、摔跤和其他体育运动。我们的母亲则等待在外面的公共看台上。城堡的男人和年轻人与我们坐在一起，向我们解释比赛规则，指出舞蹈或摔跤中的精髓，认真对待我们，让我们感到重要。我很喜欢那种感觉，但只要我从墙上下来，回家开始生活，这一切就像废弃的服装或戏剧中的角色一样从我身上脱落，我过着自己的工作和玩乐，过着真正的生活。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was ten I went to Boys’ Class downtown. The class had been set up forty or fifty years before as a bridge between the motherhouses and the Castle, but the Castle, under increasingly reactionary governance, had recently withdrawn from the project. Lord Fassaw forbade his men to go anywhere outside the walls but directly to the fuckery, in a closed car, returning at first light; and so no men were able to teach the class. The townswomen who tried to tell me what to expect when I went to the Castle did not really know much more than I did. However well-meaning they were, they mostly frightened and confused me. But fear and confusion were an appropriate preparation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>当我十岁的时候，我去了市中心的男孩班。班级是四五十年前成立的，作为脱产中途的一个纽带，但是城堡在愈发保守的统治下，最近退出了这个项目。法萨老爷禁止他的男人去城堡外的任何地方，除了闭门造车去做那种事，天一亮就回来；所以没有男人能够教这个班。镇上的女人试图告诉我去城堡要准备的事情，但她们真的不比我知道多少。不论她们的好意如何，她们大多数让我感到害怕和困惑。但恐惧和困惑是适当的准备。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I cannot describe the ceremony of Severance. I really cannot describe it. Men on Seggri, in those days, had this advantage: they knew what death is. They had all died once before their body’s death. They had turned and looked back at their whole life, every place and face they had loved, and turned away from it as the gate closed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我无法描述“离别仪式”。真的，我无法形容它。在那个时代，塞格里星球上的男人有着这样的优势：他们知道死是什么。在身体死亡之前，他们都曾经历过一次死亡。他们回首过去的生活，看到了他们所爱的一切地方和面孔，然后当大门关闭时转身离开。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the time of my Severance, our small Castle was internally divided into “collegials” and “traditionals,” a liberal faction left from the regime of Lord Ishog and a younger, highly conservative faction. The split was already disastrously wide when I came to the Castle. Lord Fassaw’s rule had grown increasingly harsh and irrational. He governed by corruption, brutality, and cruelty. All of us who lived there were of course infected, and would have been destroyed if there had not been a strong, constant, moral resistance, centered around Ragaz and Kohadrat, who had been proteges of Lord Ishog. The two men were open partners; their followers were all the homosexuals in the Castle, and a good number of other men and older boys.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>在我去世时，我们的小城堡内部被分为“学院派”和“传统派”。自Ishog勋爵统治时期留下的自由派派系和一支年轻的极保守派形成了分裂。当我来到城堡时，这个分裂已经非常严重。Fassaw大人的统治变得越来越严苛和不理智。他靠腐败、残暴和残忍来统治。我们所有住在那里的人都被感染了，如果没有Ragaz和Kohadrat为代表的坚强、持久、道德的抵抗，我们将被摧毁。这两个人是公开的伴侣；他们的追随者都是城堡里的同性恋者，还有一些其他男性和较年长的男孩。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first days and months in the Scrubs’ dormitory were a bewildering alternation: terror, hatred, shame, as the boys who had been there a few months or years longer than I were incited to humiliate and abuse the newcomer, in order to make a man of him — and comfort, gratitude, love, as boys who had come under the influence of the collegials offered me secret friendship and protection. They helped me in the games and competitions and took me into their beds at night, not for sex but to keep me from the sexual bullies. Lord Fassaw detested adult homosexuality and would have reinstituted the death penalty if the Town Council had allowed it. Though he did not dare punish Ragaz and Kohadrat, he punished consenting love between older boys with bizarre and appalling physical mutilations — ears cut into fringes, fingers branded with red-hot iron rings. Yet he encouraged the older boys to rape the eleven- and twelve-year-olds, as a manly practice. None of us escaped. We particularly dreaded four youths, seventeen or eighteen years old when I came there, who called themselves the Lordsmen. Every few nights they raided the Scrubs’ dormitory for a victim, whom they raped as a group. The collegials protected us as best they could by ordering us to their beds, where we wept and protested loudly, while they pretended to abuse us, laughing and jeering. Later, in the dark and silence, they comforted us with candy, and sometimes, as we grew older, with a desired love, gentle and exquisite in its secrecy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>在监狱宿舍的头几天和几个月里，我备受困扰地经历了一连串的变化：恐惧，憎恶，羞耻。年龄比我大几个月或几年的男孩会挑衅、羞辱和虐待新来的人，以此来让他变成男人，而那些曾在义工影响下的男孩却会私下与我成为朋友并保护我。他们帮助我参加游戏和比赛，晚上带我上床，并非为了性爱，而是为了防止那些性暴力者侵害我。福索男爵非常憎恶成年男性间的同性恋行为，如果市议会允许，他会重新实行死刑。虽然他不敢对拉加茨和科哈德拉特进行处罚，但他会对年长男孩之间出现的同意恋爱进行奇怪而令人惊骇的肢体毁伤——如将耳朵割成了碎发状、用烙铁环烙指尖。但他却鼓励年长男孩强奸十一至十二岁的孩子，作为男子汉的练习。我们都未能幸免。我们特别害怕四名年龄约十七或十八岁的年轻人，他们自称为大人物。他们每隔几个晚上就会来袭击这个地方，强奸一名受害者。志工们会尽力保护我们，将我们安排到他们的床上。我们会哭泣和大声抗议，而他们会假装虐待我们，嬉笑和嘲讽。晚些时候，在黑暗和寂静中，他们会送我们糖果，有时，随着我们的成长，他们会给我们一份渴望的爱，那种秘密的、温和的和细腻的爱。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was no privacy at all in the Castle. I have said that to women who asked me to describe life there, and they thought they understood me. “Well, everybody shares everything in a motherhouse,” they would say, “everybody’s in and out of the rooms all the time. You’re never really alone unless you have a singlewoman’s flat.” I could not tell them how different the loose, warm commonality of the motherhouse was from the rigid, deliberate publicity of the forty-bed, brightly-lighted Castle dormitories. Nothing in Rakedr was private: only secret, only silent. We ate our tears.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>城堡里一点隐私都没有。我曾经这样告诉想要了解那里生活的女人们，她们认为她们明白了我说的。&amp;quot;母住宅里大家分享一切，房间里一直有人进进出出，你唯一真正独处的机会就是有一间单人公寓&amp;quot;，她们会这样说。然而我无法告诉她们母住宅中宽松而温馨的共同生活与拘谨而刻意的纪律严密的城堡宿舍是多么不同。在瑞克德尔，没有任何东西是私密的：只有秘密，只有沉默。我们含泪吃饭。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I grew up; I take some pride in that, along with my profound gratitude to the boys and men who made it possible. I did not kill myself, as several boys did during those years, nor did I kill my mind and soul, as some did so their body could survive. Thanks to the maternal care of the collegials — the resistance, as we came to call ourselves — I grew up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我长大了；我为此感到自豪，也深深感激那些使这成为可能的男孩和男人们。在那些岁月里，我没有像几个男孩那样自杀，也没有像一些人那样杀死我的心灵和灵魂，以便让我的身体存活。多亏了集体母亲般的照顾——正如我们所称呼的那样——抵抗力量，我长大了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why do I say maternal, not paternal? Because there were no fathers in my world. There were only sires. I knew no such word as father or paternal. I thought of Ragaz and Kohadrat as my mothers. I still do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>为什么我说母系，而不是父系？因为在我的世界里没有父亲。那里只有公狗。我不知道“父亲”或者“父系”这个词。我把雷格兹和科哈德特视为我的母亲。直到现在依旧如此。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fassaw grew quite mad as the years went on, and his hold over the Castle tightened to a deathgrip. The Lordsmen now ruled us all. They were lucky in that we still had a strong Maingame team, the pride of Fassaw’s heart, which kept us in the First League, as well as two Champion Sires in steady demand at the town fuckeries. Any protest the resistance tried to bring to the Town Council could be dismissed as typical male whining, or laid to the demoralizing influence of the aliens. From the outside Rakedr Castle seemed all right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>随着时间的推移，法索（Fassaw）变得非常疯狂，他对城堡的控制变得更加紧密。贵族现在统治着我们。他们走运的是，我们仍然有一支强大的梅因盖姆（Maingame）球队，是法索最自豪的球队，让我们在第一联赛中保持了地位，并且在城镇的公共场所有两匹冠军种马，需求稳定。任何反抗组织试图向城镇委员会提出的抗议都可以被视为典型的男性抱怨，或者归咎于外星人的泄气影响。从外面看，拉克德尔城堡似乎没什么问题。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Look at our great team! Look at our champion studs! The women looked no further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>看看我们伟大的团队！看看我们的冠军种马！女人再也不需要寻找了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How could they abandon us? — the cry every Seggrian boy must make in his heart. How could she leave me here? Doesn’t she know what it’s like? Why doesn’t she know? Doesn’t she want to know?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他们怎么能够抛弃我们？这是每个瑟格里亚男孩心中的呼喊。她怎么可以把我留在这里？她难道不知道这是什么感觉吗？为什么她不明白呢？难道她不想了解吗？
“Of course not,” Ragaz said to me when I came to him in a passion of righteous indignation, the Town Council having denied our petition to be heard. “Of course they don’t want to know how we live. Why do they never come into the castles? Oh, we keep them out, yes; but do you think we could keep them out if they wanted to enter? My dear, we collude with them and they with us in maintaining the great foundation of ignorance and lies on which our civilization rests.”
&amp;quot;当我激烈表达公正愤怒的心情，城镇议会拒绝了我们的请愿书申请听证会时，拉加兹对我说，“当然不会想要知道我们是如何生活的。为什么他们从未进入城堡？哦，是的，我们把他们拒之门外。但是如果他们想进入，我们能把他们拒之门外吗？亲爱的，我们与他们勾结，在维护文明基础上的无知和谎言。”&amp;quot;
“Our own mothers abandon us,” I said.“Abandon us? Who feeds us, clothes us, houses us, pays us? We’re utterly dependent on them. If ever we made ourselves independent, perhaps we could rebuild society on a foundation of truth.”Independence was as far as his vision could reach. Yet I think his mind groped further, towards what he could not see, the body’s obscure, inalterable dream of mutuality.
“我们自己的母亲都抛弃了我们，”我说。“抛弃我们？是谁养育我们，给我们衣服穿，房子住，付钱给我们？我们完全依赖她们。如果我们能够独立，也许我们可以在真相的基础上重建社会。”独立是他的视野所能及的极限。然而，我认为他的思维还在摸索更远的地方，那是身体模糊、不可改变的相互关系梦想所在的地方。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our effort to make our case heard at the Council had no effect except within the Castle. Lord Fassaw saw his power threatened. Within a few days Ragaz was seized by the Lordsmen and their bully boys, accused of repeated homosexual acts and treasonable plots, arraigned, and sentenced by the Lord of the Castle. Everyone was summoned to the Gamefield to witness the punishment. A man of fifty with a heart ailment — he had been a Maingame racer in his twenties and had overtrained — Ragaz was tied naked across a bench and beaten with “Lord Long,” a heavy leather tube filled with lead weights. The Lordsman Berhed, who wielded it, struck repeatedly at the head, the kidneys, and the genitals. Ragaz died an hour or two later in the infirmary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我们在议会上为我们的案件发言的努力除了城堡内没有产生任何效果。Fassaw领主看到他的权力受到威胁。几天之内，Ragaz被Lordsmen及其恶棍所抓，指控其有重复的同性恋行为和叛国阴谋，接受审讯和被城堡领主判刑。每个人都被传唤到Gamefield观看惩罚。Ragaz是一个五十岁的心脏病患者，二十多岁的时候曾经是一名Maingame赛车手，被过度训练。他赤身裸体地被绑在长凳上，用“长领主”这种用铅质物填充的重皮筒子被捆打。持鞭的Lordsman Berhed反复打头，肾脏和生殖器。 Ragaz在隔天早上的诊所去世了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Rakedr Mutiny took shape that night. Kohadrat, older than Ragaz and devastated by his loss, could not restrain or guide us. His vision had been of a true resistance, longlasting and nonviolent, through which the Lordsmen would in time destroy themselves. We had been following that vision. Now we let it go. We dropped the truth and grabbed weapons. “How you play is what you win,” Kohadrat said, but we had heard all those old saws. We would not play the patience game any more. We would win, now, once for all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>雷克德尔叛乱在那个夜晚开始酝酿。 Kohadrat比Ragaz年长，因失去Ragaz而心灰意冷，无法制止或指导我们。他的愿景一直是真正的抵抗，持久且非暴力，通过它，Lordsmen将在未来自毁。 我们一直在追寻这个愿景。 现在我们让它消失了。 我们放弃了真理，拿起了武器。 “你怎么玩就是你赢得什么，” Kohadrat说，但我们已经听腻了这些老生常谈。 我们将不再玩耐心游戏。 我们会赢，现在，一劳永逸。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we did. We won. We had our victory. Lord Fassaw, the Lordsmen and their bullies had been slaughtered by the time the police got to the Gate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>然后我们成功了。我们赢了，获得了胜利。Fassaw勋爵、Lordsmen以及他们的打手在警察到达门口之前就被杀害了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember how those tough women strode in among us, staring at the rooms of the Castle which they had never seen, staring at the mutilated bodies, eviscerated, castrated, headless — at Lordsman Berhepl, who had been nailed to the floor with “Lord Long” stuffed down his throat — at us, the rebels, the victors, with our bloody hands and defiant faces — at Kohadrat, whom we thrust forward as our leader, our spokesman.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我记得那些强硬的女性踏入我们中间，注视着他们从未见过的城堡房间，注视着那些被肢解、剖腹、割去头颅的尸体——注视着被钉在地板上、喉咙里被塞着“龙勋爵”的伯哈普勒领主——还有我们这些反抗者，胜利者，手上沾满血迹，带着挑衅的面容——注视着我们推选的领袖、发言人科哈德拉特。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He stood silent. He ate his tears.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他站着保持沉默。他咽下了眼泪。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The women drew closer to one another, clutching their guns, staring around. They were appalled, they thought us all insane. Their utter incomprehension drove one of us at last to speak — a young man, Tarsk, who wore the iron ring that had been forced onto his finger when it was red-hot. “They killed Ragaz,” he said. “They were all mad. Look.” He held out his crippled hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>女人们走近彼此，抓紧枪支，四处张望。她们感到震惊，认为我们全都疯了。她们的彻底不理解最终促使我们中的一个人开口说话——一个年轻人塔斯克，他戴着一枚烙铁烙在他手指上时烧红的铁环。“他们杀了拉加兹，”他说。“他们都发疯了，看看吧。”他伸出残疾的手。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The chief of the troop, after a pause, said, “No one will leave here till this is looked into,” and marched her women out of the Castle, out of the park, locking the gate behind them, leaving us with our victory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>队伍的首领停顿了一下后说：“在这件事情弄清之前，没有人能离开这里。”然后带领着她的女人们走出了城堡，走出了公园，并锁上了大门，把我们留在这里享受胜利。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The hearings and judgments on the Rakedr Mutiny were all broadcast, of course, and the event has been studied and discussed ever since. My own part in it was the murder of the Lordsman Tatiddi. Three of us set on him and beat him to death with exercise-clubs in the gymnasium where we had cornered him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>当然，Rakedr叛乱的听证和判决都进行了广播，并且这一事件自那以后就一直被研究和讨论。我在其中的角色是谋杀了Lordsman Tatiddi。我们三个人在体育馆里用运动棒将他打死，我们把他困在那里。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How we played was what we won.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我们赢得的是我们玩的方式。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were not punished. Men were sent from several castles to form a government over Rakedr Castle. They learned enough of Fassaw’s behavior to see the cause of our rebellion, but the contempt of even the most liberal of them for us was absolute. They treated us not as men, but as irrational, irresponsible creatures, untamable cattle. If we spoke they did not answer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我们没有被惩罚。从几个城堡派来了一些男子来在拉克德城堡组建政府。他们了解到足够的法萨行为来看到我们反叛的原因，但即使是他们中最自由的人也对我们的蔑视是绝对的。他们不将我们视为人，而是视为不理性、不负责任、难以驯服的家畜。如果我们说话，他们也不会回答。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do not know how long we could have endured that cold regime of shame. It was only two months after the Mutiny that the World Council enacted the Open Gate Law. We told one another that that was our victory, we had made that happen. None of us believed it. We told one another we were free. For the first time in history, any man who wanted to leave his castle could walk out the gate. We were free!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我不知道我们能忍受多久那种冰冷的耻辱制度。在叛乱之后仅仅两个月，世界委员会颁布了开放门禁法。我们互相告诉自己那是我们的胜利，是我们争取来的。但其实没有人相信。我们彼此告诉自己我们自由了。历史上第一次，任何一个想要离开自己城堡的人都可以走出城门。我们终于自由了！&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What happened to the free man outside the gate? Nobody had given it much thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>门外的自由人发生了什么？没人多想过。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was one who walked out the gate, on the morning of the day the law came into force. Eleven of us walked into town together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我是那天早晨走出大门的人，当这项法律生效时。我们中有11人一起走进城里。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Several of us, men not from Rakedr, went to one or another of the fuckeries, hoping to be allowed to stay there; they had nowhere else to go. Hotels and inns of course would not accept men. Those of us who had been children in the town went to our motherhouses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我们几个来自不是拉克德尔的男人，去过一两个妓院，希望能住在那里；我们别无去处。当然，酒店和旅馆不会接受男人。我们中有些人是城镇中的孩子，他们去了他们的母亲家。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is it like to return from the dead? Not easy. Not for the one who returns, nor for his people. The place he occupied in their world has closed up, ceased to be, filled with accumulated change, habit, the doings and needs of others. He has been replaced. To return from the dead is to be a ghost: a person for whom there is no room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>从死亡中回归是什么感觉？不容易。不仅对回归者而言，也非常困难对其亲友而言。他在他们世界中的位置已经封闭、消逝，被变化、习惯、他人的行为及需求所填满。他已经被取代。从死亡中返回就像成为了幽灵：一个没有容身之处的人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neither I nor my family understood that, at first. I came back to them at twenty-one as trustingly as if I were the eleven-year-old who had left them, and they opened their arms to their child. But he did not exist. Who was I?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我和我的家人一开始都没有明白这一点。当我21岁回到家中时，我像11岁离开他们时一样信任地回到他们身边，他们为他们的孩子敞开了怀抱。但他并不存在。我是谁？&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a long time, months, we refugees from the Castle hid in our motherhouses. The men from other towns all made their way home, usually by begging a ride with teams on tour. There were seven or eight of us in Rakedr, but we scarcely ever saw one another. Men had no place on the street; for hundreds of years a man seen alone on the street had been arrested immediately. If we went out, women ran from us, or reported us, or surrounded and threatened us — “Get back into your Castle where you belong! Get back to the fuckery where you belong! Get out of our city!” They called us drones, and in fact we had no work, no function at all in the community. The fuckeries would not accept us for service, because we had no guarantee of health and good behavior from a castle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>很久以来，几个月，我们这些城堡里的难民一直隐藏在我们的母亲的小屋里。其他城镇的男人都会通过请求跟随旅行车队回家。在Rakedr，我们有七八个人，但我们几乎从未见过彼此。男人在街上没有地位，在数百年间，一个单独的男人被看到在街上会立刻被逮捕。如果我们出去，女人会逃离我们，或者报告我们，或者包围并威胁我们，“回到你所属的城堡！回到你所属的淫乱场所！离开我们的城市！”他们称我们为蜂王，在社区中，我们没有工作，没有任何职能。淫乱场所不会接受我们提供服务，因为我们没有来自城堡的健康和良好行为的保证。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was our freedom: we were all ghosts, useless, frightened, frightening intruders, shadows in the corners of life. We watched life going on around us — work, love, childbearing, childrearing, getting and spending, making and shaping, governing and adventuring — the women’s world, the bright, full, real world — and there was no room in it for us. All we had ever learned to do was play games and destroy one another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>这就是我们的自由：我们都是幽灵，无用的、害怕的、可怕的入侵者，生活的角落里的影子。我们看着生活在我们周围发生——工作、爱情、生育、抚养孩子、买买买、创造、统治和冒险——那是女人的世界，明亮、充实而真实的世界，而我们却在其中找不到自己的位置。我们所学的唯一技能只是玩游戏和互相摧毁。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mothers and sisters racked their brains, I know, to find some place and use for me in their lively, industrious household. Two old live-in cooks had run our kitchen since long before I was born, so cooking, the one practical art I had been taught in the Castle, was superfluous. They found household tasks for me, but they were all make-work, and they and I knew it. I was perfectly willing to look after the babies, but one of the grandmothers was very jealous of that privilege, and also some of my sisters’ wives were uneasy about a man touching their baby. My sister Pado broached the possibility of an apprenticeship in the clayworks, and I leaped at the chance; but the managers of the Pottery, after long discussion, were unable to agree to accept men as employees. Their hormones would make male workers unreliable, and female workers would be uncomfortable, and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我的母亲和姐妹们费尽心思地寻找适合我在他们充满生机和勤劳的家庭中发挥作用的地方。由于两个老厨师自我身为我出生之前就曾经经营我们的厨房，因此我学习的唯一实用技能——烹饪已经显得很多余了。她们为我找到了一些家务事做，但这些都是一些填空的工作，她们和我都知道这点。我很愿意照看婴儿们，但其中一个祖母非常嫉妒那项特权，另外我的几个姐妹婆婆也不太放心男人接触他们的孩子。我姐妹帕多提到了在陶制作坊的学习可能性，而我对这个机会充满了热情。但经过长时间的讨论，陶器厂经理们无法同意接受男性作为雇员。他们认为男性工人由于存在荷尔蒙等因素使得其不可靠，而女性工人则会感到不舒服等等。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The holonews was full of such proposals and discussions, of course, and orations about the unforeseen consequences of the Open Gate Law, the proper place of men, male capacities and limitations, gender as destiny. Feeling against the Open Gate policy ran very strong, and it seemed that every time I watched the holo there was a woman talking grimly about the inherent violence and irresponsibility of the male, his biological unfitness to participate in social and political decision-making. Often it was a man saying the same things. Opposition to the new law had the fervent support of all the conservatives in the castles, who pleaded eloquently for the gates to be closed and men to return to their proper station, pursuing the true, masculine glory of the games and the fuckeries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>全息新闻充满了这样的提议和讨论，当然，也有关于“开放之门法”的意想不到的后果，男性的适当地位、男性能力和局限性、性别的命运等方案和演说。阻挡“开放之门法”的情绪非常强烈，每次我看全息新闻时，似乎都会有一个女人严肃地谈论男性的天生暴力和不负责任，以及他们在社会和政治决策中参与的生物学不适合性。往往有男人说相同的话。新法律的反对派得到了城堡中所有保守派的热烈支持，他们哀求着关闭门户，让男人回到他们应该在的位置，追求真正的男子气概、游戏和荒唐行为的荣耀。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Glory did not tempt me, after the years at Rakedr Castle; the word itself had come to mean degradation to me. I ranted against the games and competitions, puzzling most of my family, who loved to watch the Maingames and wrestling, and complained only that the level of excellence of most of the teams had declined since the gates were opened. And I ranted against the fuckeries, where, I said, men were used as cattle, stud bulls, not as human beings. I would never go there again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>荣耀并没有引起我的诱惑，尤其是在离开雷克德城堡后的这些年里，这个词对我来说已经是一种耻辱了。我咆哮着反对各种比赛和竞争，让我的家人疑惑不解，他们喜欢观看梅因游戏和摔跤比赛，只抱怨大部分团队的卓越水平下降了，自从比赛场馆对外开放以来。我还咆哮着反对那些淫乱的事情，我说，那里把男人当作牲畜、种公牛一样使用，而不是看待他们为人类。我再也不会去那里了。
“But my dear boy,” my mother said at last, alone with me one evening, “will you live the rest of your life celibate?”
“但是，我亲爱的孩子，”晚上她和我独处时妈妈终于说道，“你会过完余生独身吗？”
“I hope not,” I said.
&amp;quot;我希望不是&amp;quot;，我说。
“Then… ?”
“那么…？”
“I want to get married.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我想要结婚。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her eyes widened. She brooded a bit, and finally ventured, “To a man.”“No. To a woman. I want a normal, ordinary marriage. I want to have a wife and be a wife.”Shocking as the idea was, she tried to absorb it. She pondered, frowning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>她瞪大了眼睛。她沉思了一会儿，最终冒险说道：“对一个男人。”“不是的。对一个女人。我想要一个正常普通的婚姻。我想要有一个妻子，成为一个妻子。”虽然这个想法让人震惊，但她试图接受它。她皱眉思考着。
“All it means,” I said, for I had had a long time with nothing to do but ponder, “is that we’d live together just like any married pair. We’d set up our own daughterhouse, and be faithful to each other, and if she had a child I’d be its lovemother along with her. There isn’t any reason why it wouldn’t work!”
“我的意思是，”我说，因为我已经有很长时间什么事情也不做，只有沉思，“就是我们将像任何已婚夫妻一样生活在一起。我们将建立我们自己的家庭，对彼此忠诚，如果她有孩子，我将和她一起是孩子的爱母亲。没有任何原因不能行得通！”
“Well, I don’t know — I don’t know of any,” said my mother, gentle and judicious, and never happy at saying no to me. “But you do have to find the woman, you know.”
‘嗯，我不知道——我不知道有没有，’我母亲温和而明智地说道，从不愿意对我说不。‘但你必须找到那个女人，你知道的。’
“I know,” I said glumly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我黯然地说：“我知道。”
“It’s such a problem for you to meet people,” she said. “Perhaps if you went to the fuckery… ? I don’t see why your own motherhouse couldn’t guarantee you just as well as a castle. We could try — ?”
“你交朋友真是个问题，”她说。“也许去公共场所多认识人就不是问题了… 我不明白为什么你的修道院不能像城堡一样保证你的安全。我们可以试试怎么样？”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I passionately refused. Not being one of Fassaw’s sycophants, I had seldom been allowed to go to the fuckery; and my few experiences there had been unfortunate. Young, inexperienced, and without recommendation, I had been selected by older women who wanted a plaything. Their practiced skill at arousing me had left me humiliated and enraged. They patted and tipped me as they left. That elaborate, mechanical excitation and their condescending coldness were vile to me, after the tenderness of my lover-protectors in the Castle. Yet women attracted me physically as men never had; the beautiful bodies of my sisters and their wives, all around me constantly now, clothed and naked, innocent and sensual, the wonderful heaviness and strength and softness of women’s bodies, kept me continually aroused. Every night I masturbated, fantasizing my sisters in my arms. It was unendurable. Again I was a ghost, a raging, yearning impotence in the midst of untouchable reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>但我激烈地拒绝了。我不是法萨乌的马屁精之一，很少被允许去淫窟；我在那里的几次经历都很不幸。年轻、没有经验、没有推荐信的我，被选择成为那些想要玩物的年长女人们的对象。她们熟练的激起我，让我感到受辱和愤怒。她们离开时拍拍我，留给我小费。那种复杂的、机械的刺激和她们高高在上的冷漠是我所厌烦的，与城堡里我那些恋人-保护者的温柔相比，更是下贱。但是女性对我有身体上的吸引力，而男人从来没有。我的姐妹和她们的妻子们美丽的身体不断地出现在我周围，穿着或赤裸着，既纯真又性感，女性身体的美好、沉重、强壮和柔软让我不断地兴奋。每晚我都在幻想我的姐妹们在我的怀里，手淫以解决我的欲望。这是不可忍受的。我又成了一个幽灵，在不可触及的现实中狂怒、渴望和无能。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I began to think I would have to go back to the Castle. I sank into a deep depression, an inertia, a chill darkness of the mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我开始想我可能不得不回到城堡。我陷入了深深的沮丧，一种惯性，一种思想的冰冷黑暗。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My family, anxious, affectionate, busy, had no idea what to do for me or with me. I think most of them thought in their hearts that it would be best if I went back through the gate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我的家人焦虑、爱护、忙碌，不知道该为我做什么或和我做什么。我认为他们大多数人心里想的是我最好回到过去的那扇门。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One afternoon my sister Pado, with whom I had been closest as a child, came to my room — they had cleared out a dormer attic for me, so that I had room at least in the literal sense. She found me in my now constant lethargy, lying on the bed doing nothing at all. She breezed in, and with the indifference women often show to moods and signals, plumped down on the foot of the bed and said, “Hey, what do you know about the man who’s here from the Ekumen?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>一天下午，我与小时候最亲密的姐姐帕多相见。他们为我清理了一个斜顶阁楼，至少从字面上来说，我有了空间。她发现我一直在床上懒散地躺着，什么也不干。她毫不在意地进来，坐在床脚上，问道:“嘿，你知道那个从Ekumen来的男人吗？”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I shrugged and shut my eyes. I had been having rape fantasies lately. I was afraid of her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我耸了耸肩膀，闭上了眼睛。最近我一直在幻想被强奸，我害怕她。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She talked on about the offworlder, who was apparently in Rakedr to study the Mutiny. “He wants to talk to the resistance,” she said. “Men like you. The men who opened the gates. He says they won’t come forward, as if they were ashamed of being heroes.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>她滔滔不绝地谈论着那个显然是为了研究叛乱而来到Rakedr的外星人。“他想和反抗组织谈话，”她说。“像你这样的人。打开城门的人。他说他们不会站出来，好像对自己是英雄感到羞耻一样。”
“Heroes!” I said. The word in my language is gendered female. It refers to the semi-divine, semi-historic protagonists of the Epics.
“英雄!”我说道。在我的语言中这个词是女性化的。它指的是史诗中半神半历史性的主角。
“It’s what you are,” Pado said, intensity breaking through her assumed breeziness. “You took responsibility in a great act. Maybe you did it wrong. Sassume did it wrong in the &lt;em>Founding of Emmo&lt;/em>, didn’t she, she let Faradr get killed. But she was still a hero. She took the responsibility. So did you. You ought to go talk to this Alien. Tell him what happened. Nobody really knows what happened at the Castle. You owe us the story.”
“这就是你的本质，”帕多语气突然转为紧张，“在伟大的行为中，你承担了责任。也许你做错了。萨苏姆在《艾默创立》时也做错了，她让法拉德遇害了，但她仍是英雄，因为她承担了责任。你也一样承担了责任。你应该去和这个外星人谈一谈，告诉他发生了什么。没有人真正知道城堡里发生了什么。你欠我们一个交代。”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was a powerful phrase, among my people. “The untold story mothers the lie,” was the saying. The doer of any notable act was held literally &lt;em>accountable&lt;/em> for it to the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>那是一个在我们的族群中非常有力的说法。&amp;quot;未被讲述的故事孕育谎言&amp;quot;，就是这个意思。任何显著行为的执行者应该对社区负有实际的&lt;em>问责&lt;/em>责任。
“So why should I tell it to an Alien?” I said, defensive of my inertia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我不知道为什么我要告诉一个外星人。我为我的惰性辩护。
“Because he’ll listen,” my sister said dryly. “We’re all too damned busy.”
&amp;quot;因为他会听,&amp;quot; 我妹妹干巴巴地说道. &amp;quot;我们都太忙了.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was profoundly true. Pado had seen a gate for me and opened it; and I went through it, having just enough strength and sanity left to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>这是非常真实的。Pado为我看到了一扇门并打开了它；我穿过它，仅剩足够的力量和理智让我这样做。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mobile Noem was a man in his forties, born some centuries earlier on Terra, trained on Hain, widely traveled; a small, yellow-brown, quick-eyed person, very easy to talk to. He did not seem at all masculine to me, at first; I kept thinking he was a woman, because he acted like one. He got right to business, with none of the maneuvering to assert his authority or jockeying for position that men of my society felt obligatory in any relationship with another man. I was used to men being wary, indirect, and competitive. Noem, like a woman, was direct and receptive. He was also as subtle and powerful as any man or woman I had known, even Ragaz. His authority was in fact immense; but he never stood on it. He sat down on it, comfortably, and invited you to sit down with him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Noem是一个四十多岁的人，在几个世纪前出生在Terra上，在Hain接受过培训，广泛旅行过；一个小个子、黄棕色皮肤、眼睛很灵活的人，很容易交流。一开始，他并没有给我留下特别男性化的印象；我总是认为他是个女人，因为他的举止像一个女人。他马上谈起了生意，而没有像我社会中的男性那样施展自己的权威或者寻找地位。我已经习惯了男性的谨慎、迂回和竞争。Noem像一个女人一样直接并且接纳。他同样像我所见过的任何男人或女人那样机智而有力，甚至比Ragaz还要厉害。他的权威实际上是巨大的，但他从不依赖它，反而把它当成是舒适的坐垫，邀请你与他一起坐下。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was the first of the Rakedr mutineers to come forward and tell our story to him. He recorded it, with my permission, to use in making his report to the Stabiles on the condition of our society, “the matter of Seggri,” as he called it. My first description of the Mutiny took less than an hour. I thought I was done. I didn’t know, then, the inexhaustible desire to learn, to understand, to hear &lt;em>all&lt;/em> the story, that characterizes the Mobiles of the Ekumen. Noem asked questions, I answered; he speculated and extrapolated, I corrected; he wanted details, I furnished them — telling the story of the Mutiny, of the years before it, of the men of the Castle, of the women of the Town, of my people, of my life — little by little, bit by bit, all in fragments, a muddle. I talked to Noem daily for a month. I learned that the story has no beginning, and no story has an end. That the story is all muddle, all middle. That the story is never true, but that the lie is indeed a child of silence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我是芮克德兵变的第一位站出来向他讲述我们故事的人。在我允许的情况下，他记录了下来，并用于向斯塔比尔报告我们社会的状况，“塞格里的事”就是他所称的。我第一次描述叛变花了不到一个小时的时间。我以为我做到了。当时我不知道，Ekumen的Mobiles具有极强的学习和理解欲望，想要听到这个故事的&lt;em>全部&lt;/em>内容。Noem问问题，我回答；他进行推测和外推，我纠正；他想要细节，我提供——逐渐地，一点点地，整个故事就像一团蒟蒻。我每天与Noem交谈一个月，我认识到这个故事没有开头，没有结尾，它就是一团蒟蒻，一直在进行中。这个故事从来不完全属实，但谎言确实是沉默的产物。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the end of the month I had come to love and trust Noem, and of course to depend on him. Talking to him had become my reason for being. I tried to face the fact that he would not stay in Rakedr much longer. I must learn to do without him. Do what? There were things for men to do, ways for men to live, he proved it by his mere existence; but could I find them?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>到月底时，我已经爱上了诺姆并信任他，当然也离不开他了。和他聊天已成为我生活的意义。我尝试接受他不会再在 Rakedr 待很久的事实。我必须学会没有他怎么办。怎么办呢？男人有很多事情要做，有很多生活方式，他就是通过自身的存在来证明这一点；但是我能找到吗？&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He was keenly aware of my situation, and would not let me withdraw, as I began to do, into the lethargy of fear again; he would not let me be silent. He asked me impossible questions. “What would you be if you could be anything?” he asked me, a question children ask each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他非常清楚我的处境，不允许我再次陷入恐惧的麻木状态，也不让我保持沉默。他问我一些不可能的问题。“如果你能成为任何事物，你会成为什么？” 他问我，这是孩子们互相问的问题。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I answered at once, passionately — “A wife!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我马上兴致勃勃地回答道：“妻子！”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know now what the flicker that crossed his face was. His quick, kind eyes watched me, looked away, looked back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我现在知道，他脸上闪过的那个东西是什么了。他那双快速而温柔的眼睛看着我，又把目光移开，再看回来。
“I want my own family,” I said. “Not to live in my mothers’ house, where I’m always a child. Work. A wife, wives — children — to be a mother. I want life, not games!”
“我想要自己的家庭，”我说。“不想住在我妈妈家里，那里我永远都是个孩子。工作。妻子，妻子们——孩子们——做个母亲。我想要的是生活，不是游戏！”
“You can’t bear a child,” he said gently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他轻柔地说道：“你无法生育。”
“No, but I can mother one!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>不是，但我能做母亲！
“We gender the word,” he said. “I like it better your way… But tell me, Ardar, what are the chances of your marrying — meeting a woman willing to marry a man? It hasn’t happened, here, has it?”
“我们把这个词与性别联系起来，”他说。“我喜欢你的方式......但是告诉我，阿德尔，你结婚的机会有多大，遇到一个愿意嫁给男人的女人？在这里还没有发生过，是吧？”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had to say no, not to my knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我不得不拒绝，因为我不知道。
“It will happen, certainly, I think,” he said (his certainties were always uncertain). “But the personal cost, at first, is likely to be high. Relationships formed against the negative pressure of a society are under terrible strain; they tend to become defensive, over-intense, unpeaceful. They have no room to grow.”
“这（Lose this, it's just a filler word）肯定会发生，我认为，”他说（他的确信总是不确定的）。 “但是个人代价，起初，很可能很高。在社会压力的负面影响下形成的关系承受着可怕的压力；它们倾向于变得防守、过度密切和不和平。它们没有成长的空间。”
“Room!” I said. And I tried to tell him my feeling of having no room in my world, no air to breathe.
“房间！”我说。我试图告诉他，我在我的世界里感到没有空间，没有空气可呼吸。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He looked at me, scratching his nose; he laughed. “There’s plenty of room in the galaxy, you know,” he said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他看着我，挠起了他的鼻子，笑了。“你知道，银河系里还有很多空间呢。”他说道。
“Do you mean… I could… That the Ekumen…” I didn’t even know what the question I wanted to ask was. Noem did. He began to answer it thoughtfully and in detail. My education so far had been so limited, even as regards the culture of my own people, that I would have to attend a college for at least two or three years, in order to be ready to apply to an offworld institution such as the Ekumenical Schools on Hain. Of course, he went on, where I went and what kind of training I chose would depend on my interests, which I would go to a college to discover, since neither my schooling as a child nor my training at the Castle had really given me any idea of what there was to be interested in. The choices offered me had been unbelievably limited, addressing neither the needs of a normally intelligent person nor the needs of my society. And so the Open Gate Law instead of giving me freedom had left me “with no air to breathe but airless Space,” said Noem, quoting some poet from some planet somewhere. My head was spinning, full of stars. “Hagka College is quite near Rakedr,” Noem said, “did you never think of applying? If only to escape from your terrible Castle?”
“你是说……我可以……通过联盟……”我甚至都不知道我想要问什么问题。诺艾姆知道，他开始仔细地思考并回答了它。我到现在都受到了如此有限的教育，即使是关于我自己民族的文化，我至少需要大学学习两三年才能准备好申请去海因的联盟学校。当然，他接着说，我去哪里和我选择什么样的培训将取决于我的兴趣，我需要去大学探索，因为我在童年时期接受的教育和在城堡的训练实际上没有给我任何有趣的想法。提供给我的选择非常有限，既不能满足一个普通聪明人的需求，也不能满足我们国家的需要。因此，“开放之门法”不是给予我自由，而是像“没有空气般的窒息，沦为空间之困境”，诺姆引用某星球某诗人的话说。我头晕目眩，星星点点。 “哈格卡学院就在拉克德尔附近，”诺艾姆说，“你从来没有考虑过申请吗？哪怕只是为了逃离你可怕的城堡？”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I shook my head. “Lord Fassaw always destroyed the application forms when they were sent to his office. If any of us had tried to apply… -”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我摇了摇头。“法萨伍勋爵总是在收到申请表后销毁它们。如果我们中的任何一个人试图申请……”
“You would have been punished. Tortured, I suppose. Yes. Well, from the little I know of your colleges, I think your life there would be better than it is here, but not altogether pleasant. You will have work to do, a place to be; but you will be made to feel marginal, inferior. Even highly educated, enlightened women have difficulty accepting men as their intellectual equals. Believe me, I have experienced it myself! And because you were trained at the Castle to compete, to want to excel, you may find it hard to be among people who either believe you incapable of excellence, or to whom the concept of competition, of winning and defeating, is valueless. But just there, there is where you will find air to breathe.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>你会被惩罚的。我想会遭受酷刑。恩，从我所知你的大学来看，我想你在那个地方的生活会比这里好，但是不完全愉快。你会有工作要做，一个地方要待；但是你会感到自己处于边缘，相对不如人。即使是高度受过教育，有着广泛视野的女性，也会很难接受男性当作其智力上的平等者。相信我，我自己就经历过这种情况！而由于你在城堡里接受的训练，要去竞争，要有出众表现，你可能会发现很难与那些要么认为你不能做出卓越成绩的人打交道，要么根本不认可竞争、获胜和失败这些概念。但就在那里，你会找到呼吸的空气。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Noem recommended me to women he knew on the faculty of Hagka College, and I was enrolled on probation. My family were delighted to pay my tuition. I was the first of us to go to college, and they were genuinely proud of me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Noem向我推荐了他在Hagka大学的认识的女教师，我被试读录取。我的家人很高兴为我的学费买单。我是我们家族中第一个上大学的人，他们为我感到非常自豪。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As Noem had predicted, it was not always easy, but there were enough other men there that I found friends and was not caught in the paralyzing isolation of the motherhouse. And as I took courage, I made friends among the women students, finding many of them unprejudiced and companionable. In my third year, one of them and I managed, tentatively and warily, to fall in love. It did not work very well or last very long, yet it was a great liberation for both of us, our liberation from the belief that the only communication or commonality possible between us was sexual, that an adult man and woman had nothing to join them but their genitals. Emadr loathed the professionalism of the fuckery as I did, and our lovemaking was always shy and brief. Its true significance was not as a consummation of desire, but as proof that we could trust each other. Where our real passion broke loose was when we lay together talking, telling each other what our lives had been, how we felt about men and women and each other and ourselves, what our nightmares were, what our dreams were. We talked endlessly, in a communion that I will cherish and honor all my life, two young souls finding their wings, flying together, not for long, but high. The first flight is the highest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>正如诺姆曾预测的那样，那段日子并不总是容易，但有足够多的其他男性，我找到了朋友，不会被困在修道院带来的麻痹孤独中。在我鼓起勇气之后，我与女学生之间交了很多朋友，发现她们大都是没有偏见而且好相处的人。在我的第三年，其中一位女生和我尝试并小心翼翼地坠入了爱河。这段恋情并不顺利，也没有持续很长时间，但对我们两人来说，它是一种解放，是我们从信念中逃离出来的，即我们之间唯一可能的交流或共性就是性关系，一个成年男人和女人之间除了生殖器之外，没有任何东西能够将它们联系在一起。艾玛迪尔像我一样讨厌性行为的专业主义，我们的爱抚总是羞涩而短暂的。它的真正意义不在于满足欲望，而在于证明我们可以互相信任。我们真正的激情在我们躺在一起交谈时爆发，彼此讲述生活经历，谈论我们对男人、女人、对彼此、对自己的感受，讲述我们的恶梦和梦想。我们无休止地交谈，在一种我将珍爱和尊重终身的交往中，两个年轻的灵魂找到了它们的翅膀，一起高高飞翔，虽然时间不长，但那是空前的初次尝试。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Emadr has been dead two hundred years; she stayed on Seggri, married into a motherhouse, bore two children, taught at Hagka, and died in her seventies. I went to Hain, to the Ekumenical Schools, and later to Werel and Yeowe as part of the Mobile’s staff; my record is herewith enclosed. I have written this sketch of my life as part of my application to return to Seggri as a Mobile of the Ekumen. I want very much to live among my people, to learn who they are, now that I know with at least an uncertain certainty who I am.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>伊玛德已经死去两百年了；她留在塞格里，嫁入了一家母院，生了两个孩子，在哈格卡教书，并在七十多岁时去世。我去了哈因，去了大公教学校，后来作为机动组的一员去了韦瑞与耶阿威；我的记录随附在此。我写下我的生平作为申请回到塞格里当大公教机动组成员的一部分。我非常想住在我的族人中间，了解他们是谁，现在我至少有点不确定的确定知道了我是谁。&lt;/p></description><category domain="https://zdaneel.github.io/femi/">femi</category></item><item><title>《中国女工》随想</title><link>https://zdaneel.github.io/femi/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%A5%B3%E5%B7%A5/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://zdaneel.github.io/femi/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%A5%B3%E5%B7%A5/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 16:24:08 +0800</pubDate><author>z1436910962@gmail.com (leenadz)</author><copyright>[CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.zh)</copyright><description>&lt;p>书的背景是上世纪的8-90年代，也就是改革开放之后，外资开始进入大陆内地，标题“中国女工”四个字其实就点明了这本书讲述的对象，三个身份“中国”、“女性”、“工人”，也分别对应了三重的压迫，分别是政治、文化和经济三个角度，具体来说“中国”对应着社会主义制度，“女性”对应着社会文化上的父权制，而“工人”则对应着经济上的国外资本主义。因为我缺少社会学的相关概念和理论知识，对我而言这本书并不好读，有不少地方只能是粗粗略过，似懂非懂，不过收获还是颇多。短短的二十年内天翻地覆，书中讲述的情况想必也会有了很多的变化，不然这本书依然是一个很优秀的社会学研究报告，能够从中窥见那个年代下中国女工的种种遭遇。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>简单描述一下那个时代的一些场景：一个外资企业，管理层都是男性或者是“男性化”的女性，工人们大多都是女性，管理城市的政府通过“管理工人数量”的理由，向外资企业收取费用，通过户籍制度来管理农村和外地的工人，除了打工，就无法在城市居住，更别提享受城市的资源。农村的一位女性，大概率会通过在工厂里的亲戚介绍而出去打工，在工厂里有亲属关系的往往会聚在一起，外出购物的时候也会想办法让自己不那么“土”，在工厂里高强度的工作会带来许多的慢性疾病，可能到25岁左右，就要考虑回农村结婚生子。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>性别显得尤为突出，与毛时代的工人去性化完全相反，毛时代没有区分性别，是因为极度缺乏劳动力，所谓的“妇女解放”，可以看作是为了增加劳动力，这种给予的权力，而不是争取来的权力，很容易说回收就被回收了。而改革开放以后对工人进行性化，用书中的话来说：“女性的行为应该符合文化的要求，恭顺、服从、勤劳、温柔等。管理者利用这些女性行为规范作为借口，培养出听话服从的女性身体劳动力。这是一种规训论述。”简单来说，就是这些企业认为女性听话、好控制。但现实不会这样符合他们的幻想，女工们是具有主体性的，她们也在用自己的方式反抗这些霸权与规训，书中就花费了很多的笔墨来描述女性身体在现代规训技术下的一系列化学反应。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>自媒体时代，尤其是短视频的兴起，给了社会中弱势群体表达和展露自我的平台，抛去短视频的其他争议不谈，能让更多本没有话语权的人说话，这毫无疑问是从古至今的一项创新之举，某种程度上具有对官方话语的对抗，在富士康的某个视频里面，墙壁上宏大的价值观和口号，与疲惫迷茫的人们形成了极强的反差，这一种撕裂的感觉也存在于社会各处，个人的苦难似乎不值得一提，甚至还会被美化，就像一种集体性的PUA。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>虽然短短的二十年发生了很多的变化，但有很多的东西依然没变，那个时代的场景放到现在，相信也存在于社会的各个地方吗，在这样的一个时代里，我们还能做些什么呢？&lt;/p></description><category domain="https://zdaneel.github.io/femi/">femi</category></item><item><title>[分享]小心这十类自称女权主义的男性</title><link>https://zdaneel.github.io/femi/%E5%B0%8F%E5%BF%83%E8%BF%99%E5%8D%81%E7%B1%BB%E8%87%AA%E7%A7%B0%E5%A5%B3%E6%9D%83%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89%E7%9A%84%E7%94%B7%E6%80%A7/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://zdaneel.github.io/femi/%E5%B0%8F%E5%BF%83%E8%BF%99%E5%8D%81%E7%B1%BB%E8%87%AA%E7%A7%B0%E5%A5%B3%E6%9D%83%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89%E7%9A%84%E7%94%B7%E6%80%A7/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 16:24:08 +0800</pubDate><author>z1436910962@gmail.com (leenadz)</author><copyright>[CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.zh)</copyright><description>&lt;h1 id="小心这十类自称女权主义的男性">小心这十类自称女权主义的男性&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>当一个男人自称女权主义者时，对一个女人来说，他潜在的危险性是最大的。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>但是，很多女权主义者，甚至其他女性都不以为然。他们说：“你怎么能分化自己的同盟呢？”、“你希望他们能有多完美？”、“为什么你总是不信任别人？”、“你是受过多大心理创伤？”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>但是，如果你是个女权主义者，正在追求与男性的恋爱及性关系，那么在约会时小心一点是很有必要的。这是一个需要注意的问题，保持警愓很重要。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>男性女权主义者对他们的男子气概社会化并不免疫一一男子气概社会化本身就是个有害的概念。他们应该努力去消除这种影响。但是一些“男性女权主义者”利用社会公平的修辞，作为他们侮辱女性行为的掩护。这样的事例比比皆是，还有更多的受害者由于害怕而沉默。显然，我们这些所谓的“同盟”将有毒的男子气概与女权主义结合，创造出了一种可怕的混合物。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>所以，听取我们的建议：..小心男性女权主义者..。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>因为有些时候，在女权主义的外表掩盖下往往隐藏着可怕的事实。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="一小心那些想要控制你性行为的男性女权主义者">一、小心那些想要控制你性行为的男性女权主义者&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>小心那些学了诸如解放、正面身体以及性主动这些词，并且利用这些词来让你觉得不跟他上床简直内疚的男人。（Body positive 正面身体：指无论身体状态如何都以正面态度接受的一种倡导。）&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些嘴上说着“我支持女性解放”，真正含义却是“我支持女人有性的主动权，但只在对我有益的情况下”的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些支持你进行性行为的权利，但却无视你不愿进行性行为的权利的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些在发生性行为时，不让你拒绝、要求你“多点花样”、（用性解放来说服你 )希望你“自己动”的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些口口声声说“不意味着不”，但实际上却认为不拒绝就是同意的男人。当他们自己的这种性暴力被质疑时，他们会辩解道：“你知道我做反强奸工作的。”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些说着“不意味着不&amp;quot;，但却告诉你那些大胆控制自己的身体，掌握性主动权的女人有什么下场都是她们自找的那些男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些声称自己反对强奸，但却认为既然碧昂斯已经成了妈妈，就不该“ 穿成那样”的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些爱看 A 片，却看不起性工作者的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些声称“真正的男人”不会那么做，就将自己与实施性犯罪和身体暴力的男人划清界限的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些不给你机会表达自己在性方面的欲望和界限的男性。他们强烈地表演着平等的样子，却从不实践公平的规则，他们口口声声说希望你说出自己的想法，但却从来不问。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>你的性 / 无性行为属于你自己。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="二小心那些对你的外表指手画脚的男性女权主义者">二、小心那些对你的外表指手画脚的男性女权主义者&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>小心那些质疑你使用睫毛膏或者剃毛刀并告诉你：“你不用为我这么做”，却无视你说你并不是为了他的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些对你说你在不化妆，不穿高跟鞋以及你喜欢的超短裙时更漂亮的男人——就好像你做这些是为了讨他们的欢心似的。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些暗示你“素颜”也很美——表面上是要帮你摆脱父权社会的束缚一一然后告诉你裸色系的唇膏比亮色好看的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些看到穿比基尼的苗条姑娘就倡导“正面身体运动”，但是用截然不同的态度对待穿比基尼的胖姑娘的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些用他们的前任来证明自己是个“机会平等、积极平权法案”的约会对象的男人。（积极平权法案：大名鼎鼎的 AA，在这里也就是各种族尽量按比例分配的意思。）&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些认为他们只和白人女孩约会仅仅是“喜好问题”，但是如果你不喜欢他们就是你不公平对待各种族的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些总是问 “你这么折腾是为了谁？”的男人，就好像为自己开心而好好打扮的理由不够充分似的。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>只有你自己能决定如何打扮你的身体。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="三小心那些在性别平等的面具下藏着虐待手段的男性女权主义者">三、小心那些在性别平等的面具下藏着虐待手段的男性女权主义者&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>小心那些用社会公平说辞来操纵你的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些当你不同意他们的观点时，用“煤气灯光效应“这种词来指责你的男人。(gaslighting 煤气灯光效应：用来指代一种通过持续否认、错误指引、自相矛盾、撒谎等方式，操纵他人，使得被操纵者对自身想法产生动摇和怀疑的一种行为。）&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些将他们受压迫的社会交叉身份作为他不可能对你施虐的证据的男人一一因为你比他们拥有更多的社会权力。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些声明自己支持反暴力工作，但是却在自己的恋爱交往中施暴的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些告诉你“施虐者动力学”就是当你生气而又说不出理由是因为此刻的你已经气到无法思考的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些在经济上剥削你，还斥责你比他挣得多的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些一生气就用婊子、荡妇、贱人这些词来称呼你或者其他女性的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些知道自己在女权主义者社群中的地位比你高，并直接或间接以此来压制你的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些问你：“你是在说我是个糟糕的女权主义者吗？”的男人一一说得好像这点指责比他们带给你的伤害还重要；说得好像这不是个转换话题的策略似的。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些在女性研究课程中了解到某某女权主义者，然后在吵架时引用她的话来转移话题，让你闭嘴的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些打着你需要激进化的幌子，迫使你采取适合他们的行为和意识形态的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>如果他们运用权力，控制你，不管他们伪装得多么完美，这就是虐待。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="四小心那些将女性特质视为竞争工具的男性女权主义者">四、小心那些将女性特质视为竞争工具的男性女权主义者&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>小心那些把你当成能把他们带到女权主义仙境的疯狂梦想仙子的男人。（疯狂梦想仙子：一种常见的电影人物类型，指一种人物单薄，充满“正能量”，在电影中的存在意义仅限于带领男性在生活中冒险，寻找美好和梦想的女性人物。典型形象如《伊丽莎白镇 》中科斯汀 • 邓斯特扮演的克菜尔。）&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些觉得自己可以裁定女性 “够不够女权”，却又把没达标的女性视作可接受的追求目标的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些将女人分为“好”和“坏”两类，然后让你们自相攻击的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些依据自己对女性行为的接受程度而将女性分为“女孩”、“女人”和“女性”的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些质疑其他女人的女权主义是否本真的男性。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些只有当你服从他们关于女权主义、女性特征、女性气质的观念时，他们才会对你表现出爱和尊重的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>女性特征不是竞争工具。&lt;/p>

&lt;p>小心那些认为批判有害的男子气概就是对他们人身攻击的男人一一仅仅因为这样的批评戳到了他们的痛处。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>他们可以不带任何感情地看待你的生活经历，只能证明他们拥有更多特权，并不能证明他们比较聪明。&lt;/p>

&lt;p>小心那些跟你的朋友讨论女权主义，却跟他的朋友开强奸玩笑的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些认为自己表达愤怒就是积极关注情绪，而你生气就是荷尔蒙作崇的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些认为避孕是你的责任，并认为既然有这么多避孕的方法可供你选择，你应该感到幸运的男人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>小心那些嘴上说着从不会伤害你，但是当你在喝酒的时候，却像苍蝇一样粘着你，想要（在没有第三个人的情况下）“照顾”你的男人。&lt;/p>

&lt;p>纪录片从导演王男栿她老家的一些情况引出，讲述了一系列因为计划生育这项国策给普通人带来的影响，提到了计划生育者、反思者、人口贩子、收养计划等等，最后用一对从小分隔异地的双胞胎姐妹作结，更让人深思。通过一个个真实而又残忍的例子，表达了对这项政策的不满。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>有人说，纪录片讲述的东西以偏概全，只讲了农村的事情而没有讲城市的事情；就算是农村的事情，地域之间的差异也会有很大。但是我觉得核心问题并不在这里，批评的人可能犯了一个完美主义谬误，因为计划生育这个政策影响到了这个国度中的每一个人，如果要把她们的故事都讲出来，那不是一部短短的纪录片所能做到的。所以我觉得通过讲述几个典型的故事，来触动人心并且引发进一步的思考，这就应该是这部纪录片想要达到的效果。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>还有人说把这些事情怪罪到政策上面是一件很肤浅的事情，没有考虑更深层次的理由。按我的理解，她想说的理由可能是传统观念里的男尊女卑，把这个当成因素当然是可以的，但这样做其实也很偷懒，而且为什么这一个传统观念根植了千年，却在短短的一段时间内出现如此密集的灾祸和悲剧呢？大量的女婴丢弃事件、妇女结扎堕胎事件、政府参与的弃婴收养事件……这些悲剧后面明显存在另外的人为的因素。在我看来，就应该把它们主要归罪于这个政策，但同时也不能忽略其他的因素。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>注意到一个情况，很多人都在说，因为这是基本国策，所以就没有办法，只能按照指令去做。不光是那些计划生育者在这么说，就连受到伤害的女性也在这么说。针对前者，让我想到了阿伦特的平庸之恶这个概念。但是呢，前段时间正好看到对这个概念的批评，平庸是平庸，恶是恶，平庸这个概括看起来很完善妥协，但实际上是个虚假的答案，把自由选择当作了特权或者是根本没有考虑。在恶的环境下，计划生育强制执行的时候，为什么这些人没有选择去放弃而是服从了呢？如果把自由选择考虑进来，那么他们所作的就是恶，他们需要承担很大一部分责任。不过这是将自由选择当成前提的，如果他们处在不去做就会被杀或者遭到迫害，那么在这样的情况下又该如何判断呢？比如片中导演的舅舅，因为他母亲的死亡威胁，就把女儿丢弃了，这样的行为又该如何评判呢？目前的我无法给出一个回答。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>对于后者，就是受到伤害的女性也在这么说：政策就是政策，我遭受的都是命运的安排。显然她们把政策当成了无法质疑的真理一般的存在。考虑到时代背景，中国共产党不断给人民灌输着党的命令是不会错的，对于很多的人来说，可能难以认识到不合理的地方，在这样的不断吸狼奶，其实就是被洗脑的情况下，只能把过错归于自己，归于命运。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>计划生育这项政策是对女性的巨大伤害，因为传统的观念，很多家庭，尤其是在农村的，都想要一个男孩，但因为计划生育，如果生下来是个女孩，那么这个女孩有可能会遭到杀害或者是抛弃，在纪录片中也可以看到，导演的家人在生下第二胎之前，就已经商量好如果生下来是个女孩，就直接把她给送走。计划生育中有标语这么说：“生男生女都一样”、“以重男轻女为耻”。但是这样的标语，完全不能起到保护女性的作用，只是用来粉饰太平的。说得越好听，越能从侧面体现现实的不公与残酷。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>这是非常爹味的一个政策，试图去控制女性的身体，比如说结扎和堕胎，这是完全违背了女性自身的意愿而进行的强制性措施。让女性失去了对自己身体的控制权，后来的二胎政策，生育权依然被他们所控制，就像他们控制着其他众多的权利一样。从很久以前开始，生育权就不是归女性所有的，到现在因为避孕产品的发明和人们观念的改善，情况稍微有所改变。在我看来生育权就应归女性所有，丈夫或者是长辈他们所给的只能是建议，而真正选择是否去生育完全取决于女性自己。用纽堡的一段话：“生孩子不是个人行为，而是个社会事件。新生命将许许多多的人调动起来，分工努力，为它的出生和成长做很多事情。”而其中调动者就是女性，由她根据自己能实际调动的人群和可预见的后果来决定生育与否。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>回到计划生育这一政策上，按照政策的宣传，实行的原因是当时中国人口多，如果不解决，将来不可收拾。那么人口多这个原因合理吗？可以看到，二胎政策放开的时候，中国人口依然很多，那么为什么就不继续计划生育了呢？显然这个决策从一开始就很有问题，引一段Song Ma的话：“人口问题属于共产党制造的伪问题，因为当时他们没有任何管理工业化社会的经验，也没有发展的眼光，不知道工业和服务业对劳动力的吸收作用，只看到原始农业和‘共产主义’社会下人口对资源的消耗，而没有看到资本+劳动力的组合。”这样看来，计划生育就是中共所作出的一项错误政策。执行的时候也有人提出质疑，但显然这个政权不会承认自己的错误。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>此外还有一个问题，计划生育的实行对控制生育率究竟起了多大的作用呢？在这方面，我比较认同阿马蒂亚·森的观点：女权进步比计划生育效果好。在他的文章中就写道，几十年来中国生育率的大幅下跌，与高压政策的关系较小，与人们做出倾向于少生子女的理性决定的关系远远更大。也就是说，中国女性受教育和就业机会的快速增加使得女性掌握了在家庭中更大的发言权，这往往会降低生育频率。在《天空的另一半》中就可以看到，受教育和就业这两项确实能完完全全改变一个地区女性的地位，也从而降低生育率，而其中并没有计划生育的身影。可以说，计划生育带来了数不清的伤害与悲剧，却成为了共产党的英明政策、成了控制生育率的最大功臣。计划生育者为了目的而不择手段，为了计划生育带来的所谓好处，不惜加害女性、杀害女婴，结果他们所坚持的目的却是虚假的，而他们很多人依然不自知。如此荒诞，就发生在这一个神奇的国度中。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>四九年以后，解放妇女这一口号的实际目的，其实并不是要改变男尊女卑的观念，真正的目的是为了增加劳动人口，从而促进经济的增长。而改革开放之后，越来越多的女性进入到工厂，带来的是女性地位在社会、家庭中地位的上升，但这种上升并不是因为人们对于男女不平等观念的改观，实际上其实是一种对钱的敬畏，因为这个社会尊崇金钱和权力，而妇女有了金钱后，她们的地位自然就提升了。但是，这个社会依然是父权社会，厌女的现象随处可见，数不清的女性仍然遭受着不公与伤害：性别歧视、性骚扰、荡妇羞辱……&lt;/p>
&lt;p>最后用纽堡的一段话作结：&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“发生过的不会被擦除。重要的是坚持信念，坚持为信念注入力量。权力依赖力量，权力也害怕力量。只要人为真正的信念注入力量，就有遏制、改写权力的那天到来。”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>海恩星系第九十三循环纪元第二四二年，塞格里星与外界进行首次接触。来自金牛座四号星的一艘太空船，历经六代船员的航行，降落在这颗行星上。船长在航行日志中记录下这次接触的始末。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="阿劳奥劳船长的报告">阿劳·奥劳船长的报告&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>在这个被当地人称为塞里或是耶里哈的行星，我们已经停留了将近四十个日夜，受到了充分的招待，我相信当地居民处于僵化停滞的史前状态。此星球的男人居住在某种壮观巍峨的建筑中，他们称之为城堡，周围环绕着广阔的公园，外围分布着精耕细作的农田和众多果园，都是从干枯焦热的沙漠里悉心开垦出来的。此星球的女人则居住在城堡外围的村落与城镇，操持着田地及作坊里的一切，人力相当充沛。她们都是一般的平民，村镇的所有权属于城堡里的贵族。村民饲养各种家禽和兽类，任由它们出入家门，有些是体型壮硕的动物。女子身穿色调灰暗的服饰，总是集体行动，她们不能进入城堡的领地，只是将食物与必需品交给守卫城门的男人。她们非常恐惧厌恶我们，我的几个男性手下试图尾随路上的女子，城镇里的女人就像抓狂的野兽一样冲出来威吓。所以我的男性手下认为，还是回到城堡比较妥当。城堡内的男人们劝告我们，最好远离她们的城镇，我们照做了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>男人们可以在庭院中自由行动，从事任意的游戏运动；夜晚降临，他们会前往设在村镇中的固定房舍，挑选喜欢的女子，随心所欲发泄自己的欲望。女子会付钱给男人，我们得知，要是能够因此怀孕，女子会付更多的钱。在晚上，肆意的交欢令男人们的肉欲得到满足，到了白天，他们则从事各式各样的运动竞技。最负盛名的是一种类似摔跤的项目，将对方抛向空中，让我们颇感惊奇的是：他们似乎从来不会因此而受伤，跌倒后立即跃起，再次投入搏斗中，身躯四肢灵活矫健。此外，他们用钝剑进行击剑，用轻便的长棍较量。除此以外， 还有一种大型的球类运动，允许用双手运球或抛球，用脚踢球或勾绊来拦截对方球员，所以在比赛达到高潮的时候，许多选手会摔伤或者拐到脚。这种比赛相当具有观赏性，两队队员身穿颜色鲜艳、对比强烈的制服，辅以艳丽花哨的金饰，成群结队满场追跑。跑锋接到抛出的球，突破对方人墙的阻挡，全速冲向场地的另一端，众人紧随其后狂烈追逐。这种比赛的场地被称作“战场”，此类场地坐落于村镇附近，周围也没有院墙的遮蔽，因此女人们可以到场观战，她们会尽情喝彩助兴，高声喊出心爱选手的名字，加油助兴的时候全然不顾什么规矩礼节。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>十一岁大的时候，小男孩就要离开母亲身边，被带进城堡，为的是让他好好接受男人的教育。我曾亲眼目睹一个男孩离家、进入城堡的庆祝场面，十分隆重而又热烈。据说，怀孕的女子很难把胚胎顺利孕育成婴儿，即便顺利产下，无论怎么悉心照料，男婴的夭折率还是相当高，所以女性的数目远远超过男性。这个倒霉的民族不信奉万能的主神，因此被施以诅咒，这些拒绝悔改的异教徒对神的教诲充耳不闻，对神的启示浑然不觉。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>这些男人对艺术知之甚少，只会跳某种富有韵律的舞蹈，而他们的科学知识与野蛮人不相上下。我曾经跟城堡中一位地位显赫的人物攀谈过。这位身披金红相间盛装的男子颇受他人敬重，并被尊称为“王子”或“勋爵”，但却无知到极点，竟然相信其他的星球也都有人类及野兽栖息，还询问我们来自哪颗星球。&lt;/p></description><category domain="https://zdaneel.github.io/femi/">femi</category></item><item><title>[分享]你男朋友</title><link>https://zdaneel.github.io/femi/%E4%BD%A0%E7%94%B7%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://zdaneel.github.io/femi/%E4%BD%A0%E7%94%B7%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 12:32:30 +0800</pubDate><author>z1436910962@gmail.com (leenadz)</author><copyright>[CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.zh)</copyright><description>&lt;h1 id="你男朋友">你男朋友&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>唉！世界上最不平的事，就是我们二万万女同胞了。从小生下来，遇着好老子，还说得过；遇着脾气杂冒、不讲情理的，满嘴连说：“晦气，又是一个没用的。”恨不得拿起来摔死。总抱着“将来是别人家的人”这句话，冷一眼、白一眼地看待；没到几岁，也不问好歹，就把一双雪白粉嫩的天足脚，用白布缠着，连睡觉的时候，也不许放松一点，到了后来肉也烂尽了，骨也折断了，不过讨亲戚、朋友、邻居们一声“某人家姑娘脚小”罢了。这还不说，到了择亲的时光，只凭着两个不要脸媒人的话，只要男家有钱有势，不问身家清白，男人的性情好坏、学问高低，就不知不觉应了。到了过门的时候，用一顶红红绿绿的花轿，坐在里面，连气也不能出。到了那边，要是遇着男人虽不怎么样，却还安分，这就算前生有福今生受了。遇着不好的，总不是说“前生作了孽”，就是说“运气不好”。要是说一二句抱怨的话，或是劝了男人几句，反了腔，就打骂俱下；别人听见还要说：“不贤惠，不晓得妇道呢！”诸位听听，这不是有冤没处诉么？还有一桩不公的事：男子死了，女子就要带三年孝，不许二嫁。女子死了，男人只带几根蓝辫线，有嫌难看的，连带也不带；人死还没三天，就出去偷鸡摸狗；七还未尽，新娘子早已进门了。上天生人，男女原没有分别。试问天下没有女人，就生出这些人来么？为什么这样不公道呢？那些男子，天天说“心是公的，待人是要和平的”，又为什么把女子当作非洲的黑奴一样看待。不公不平，直到这步田地呢？&lt;/p>
&lt;p>诸位，你要知道天下事靠人是不行的，总要求己为是。当初那些腐儒说什么“男尊女卑”、“女子无才便是德”、“夫为妻纲”这些胡说，我们女子要是有志气的，就应当号召同志与他反对，陈后主兴了这缠足的例子，我们要是有羞耻的，就应当兴师问罪；即不然，难道他捆着我的腿？我不会不缠的么？男子怕我们有知识、有学问、爬上他们的头，不准我们求学，我们难道不会和他分辨，就应了么？这总是我们女子自己放弃责任，样样事体一见男子做了，自己就乐得偷懒，图安乐。男子说我没用，我就没用；说我不行，只要保着眼前舒服，就作奴隶也不问了。自己又看看无功受禄，恐怕行不长久，一听见男子喜欢脚小，就急急忙忙把它缠了，使男人看见喜欢，庶可以藉此吃白饭。至于不叫我们读书、习字，这更是求之不得的，有甚么不赞成呢？诸位想想，天下有享现成福的么？自然是有学问、有见识、出力作事的男人得了权利，我们作他的奴隶了。既作了他的奴隶，怎么不受压制呢？自作自受，又怎么怨得人呢？这些事情，提起来，我也觉得难过，诸位想想总是个中人，亦不必用我细说。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>但是从此以后，我还望我们姐妹们，把从前事情，一概搁开，把以后事情，尽力作去，譬如从前死了，现在又转世为人了。老的呢，不要说“老而无用”，遇见丈夫好的要开学堂，不要阻他；儿子好的，要出洋留学，不要阻他。中年作媳妇的，总不要拖着丈夫的腿，使他气短志颓，功不成、名不就；生了儿子，就要送他进学堂，女儿也是如此，千万不要替他缠足。幼年姑娘的呢，若能够进学堂更好；就不进学堂，在家里也要常看书、习字。有钱作官的呢，就要劝丈夫开学堂、兴工厂，作那些与百姓有益的事情。无钱的呢，就要帮着丈夫苦作，不要偷懒吃闲饭。这就是我的望头了。诸位晓得国是要亡的了，男人自己也不保，我们还想靠他么？我们自己要不振作，到国亡的时候，那就迟了。诸位！诸位！须不可以打断我的念头才好呢！&lt;/p>
&lt;p>秋瑾&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1875年11月8日－1907年7月15日），浙江绍兴山阴人，生于福建省泉州府同安县。初名闺瑾，乳名玉姑，字璿卿，号旦吾，留学日本后改名瑾，字（或作别号）竞雄，自称鉴湖女侠，笔名秋千、汉侠女儿，曾用笔名白萍。中国近代女权运动家、革命志士，最后被清廷抓捕处决，而她的死间接促成辛亥革命。&lt;/p>

A Wandership six generations out from Iao (4-Taurus) came down on the planet, and the captain entered this report in his ship’s log.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CAPTAIN AOLAO-OLAO S REPORT&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have spent near forty days on this world they call Se-ri or Ye-ha-ri, well entertained, and leave with as good an estimation of the natives as is consonant with their unregenerate state. They live in fine great buildings they call castles, with large parks all about. Outside the walls of the parks lie well-tilled fields and abundant orchards, reclaimed by diligence from the parched and arid desert of stone that makes up the greatest part of the land. Their women live in villages and towns huddled outside the walls. All the common work of farm and mill is performed by the women, of whom there is a vast superabundance. They are ordinary drudges, living in towns which belong to the lords of the castle. They live amongst the cattle and brute animals of all kinds, who are permitted into the houses, some of which are of fair size. These women go about drably clothed, always in groups and bands. They are never allowed within the walls of the park, leaving the food and necessaries with which they provide the men at the outer gate of the castle. They evinced great fear and distrust of us. A few of my men following some girls on the road, women rushed from the town like a pack of wild beasts, so that the men thought it best to return forthwith to the castle. Our hosts advised us that it were best for us to keep away from their towns, which we did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The men go freely about their great parks, playing at one sport or another. At night they go to certain houses which they own in the town, where they may have their pick among the women and satisfy their lust upon them as they will. The women pay them, we were told, in their money, which is copper, for a night of pleasure, and pay them yet more if they get a child on them. Their nights thus are spent in carnal satisfaction as often as they desire, and their days in a diversity of sports and games, notably a kind of wrestling, in which they throw each other through the air so that we marveled that they seemed never to take hurt, but rose up and returned to the combat with wonderful dexterity of hand and foot. Also they fence with blunt swords, and combat with long light sticks. Also they play a game with balls on a great field, using the arms to catch or throw the ball and the legs to kick the ball and trip or catch or kick the men of the other team, so that many are bruised and lamed in the passion of the sport, which was very fine to see, the teams in their contrasted garments of bright colors much gauded out with gold and finery seething now this way, now that, up and down the field in a mass, from which the balls were flung up and caught by runners breaking free of the struggling crowd and fleeting towards the one or the other goal with all the rest in hot pursuit. There is a “battlefield” as they call it of this game lying without the walls of the castle park, near to the town, so that the women may come watch and cheer, which they do heartily, calling out the names of favorite players and urging them with many uncouth cries to victory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Boys are taken from the women at the age of eleven and brought to the castle to be educated as befits a man. We saw such a child brought into the castle with much ceremony and rejoicing. It is said that the women find it difficult to bring a pregnancy of a manchild to term, and that of those born many die in infancy despite the care lavished upon them, so that there are far more women than men. In this we see the curse of GOD laid upon this race as upon all those who acknowledge HIM not, unrepentant heathens whose ears are stopped to true discourse and blind to the light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These men know little of art, only a kind of leaping dance, and their science is little beyond that of savages. One great man of a castle to whom I talked, who was dressed out in cloth of gold and crimson and whom all called Prince and Grandsire with much respect and deference, yet was so ignorant he believed the stars to be worlds full of people and beasts, asking us from which star we descended. They have only vessels driven by steam along the surface of the land and water, and no notion of flight either in the air or in space, nor any curiosity about such things, saying with disdain, “That is all women’s work,” and indeed I found that if I asked these great men about matters of common knowledge such as the working of machinery, the weaving of cloth, the transmission of holovision, they would soon chide me for taking interest in womanish things as they called them, desiring me to talk as befit a man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the breeding of their fierce cattle within the parks they are very knowledgeable, as in the sewing up of their clothing, which they make from cloth the women weave in their factories. The men vie in the ornamentation and magnificence of their costumes to an extent en, swhich we might indeed have thought scarcely manly, were they not withal such proper mtrong and ready for any game or sport, and full of pride and a most delicate and fiery honor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The log including Captain Aolao-olao’s entries was (after a 12-generation journey) returned to the Sacred Archives of the Universe on Iao, which were dispersed during the period called The Tumult, and eventually preserved in fragmentary form on Hain. There is no record of further contact with Seggri until the First Observers were sent by the Ekumen in 93/1333: an Alterran man and a Hainish woman, Kaza Agad and G. Merriment. After a year in orbit mapping, photographing, recording and studying broadcasts, and analyzing and learning a major regional language, the Observers landed. Acting upon a strong persuasion of the vulnerability of the planetary culture, they presented themselves as survivors of the wreck of a fishing boat, blown far off course, from a remote island. They were, as they had anticipated, separated at once, Kaza Agad being taken to the Castle and Merriment into the town. Kaza kept his name, which was plausible in the native context; Merriment called herself Yude. We have only her report, from which three excerpts follow.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>FROM MOBILE GERINDU’UTTAHAYUDETWE’MENRADE MERRIMENT’S NOTES FOR A REPORT TO THE EKUMEN, 93/133&lt;/p>
&lt;p>34/223 Their network of trade and information, hence their awareness of what goes on elsewhere in their world, is too sophisticated for me to maintain my Stupid Foreign Castaway act any longer. Ekhaw called me in today and said, “If we had a sire here who was worth buying or if our teams were winning their games, I’d think you were a spy. Who are you, anyhow?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I said, “Would you let me go to the College at Hagka?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She said, “Why?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“There are scientists there, I think? I need to talk with them.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This made sense to her; she made their “Mh” noise of assent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Could my friend go there with me?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Shask, you mean?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were both puzzled for a moment. She didn’t expect a woman to call a man “friend,” and I hadn’t thought of Shask as a friend. She’s very young, and I haven’t taken her very seriously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I mean Kaza, the man I came with.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“A man — to the college?” she said, incredulous. She looked at me and said, “Where &lt;em>do&lt;/em> you come from?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a fair question, not asked in enmity or challenge. I wish I could have answered it, but I am increasingly convinced that we can do great damage to these people; we are facing Resehavanar’s Choice here, I fear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ekhaw paid for my journey to Hagka, and Shask came along with me. As I thought about it I saw that of course Shask was my friend. It was she who brought me into the motherhouse, persuading Ekhaw and Azman of their duty to be hospitable; it was she who had looked out for me all along. Only she was so conventional in everything she did and said that I hadn’t realized how radical her compassion was. When I tried to thank her, as our little jitney-bus purred along the road to Hagka, she said things like she always says —”Oh, we’re all family,” and “People have to help each other,” and “Nobody can live alone.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Don’t women ever live alone?” I asked her, for all the ones I’ve met belong to a motherhouse or a daughterhouse, whether a couple or a big family like Ekhaw’s, which is three generations: five older women, three of their daughters living at home, and four children —the boy they all coddle and spoil so, and three girls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Oh yes,” Shask said. “If they don’t want wives, they can be singlewomen. And old women, when their wives die, sometimes they just live alone till they die. Usually they go live at a daughterhouse. In the colleges, the &lt;em>vev&lt;/em> always have a place to be alone.” Conventional she may be, but Shask always tries to answer a question seriously and completely; she thinks about her answer. She has been an invaluable informant. She has also made life easy for me by not asking questions about where I come from. I took this for the incuriosity of a person securely embedded in an unquestioned way of life, and for the self-centeredness of the young. Now I see it as delicacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“A vev is a teacher?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Mh.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“And the teachers at the college are very respected?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“That’s what vev means. That’s why we call Eckaw’s mother Vev Kakaw. She didn’t go to college, but she’s a thoughtful person, she’s learned from life, she has a lot to teach us.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So respect and teaching are the same thing, and the only term of respect I’ve heard women use for women means teacher. And so in teaching me, young Shask respects herself? And/or earns my respect? This casts a different light on what I’ve been seeing as a society in which wealth is the important thing. Zadedr, the current mayor of Reha, is certainly admired for her very ostentatious display of possessions; but they don’t call her Vev.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I said to Shask, “You have taught me so much, may I call you Vev Shask?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She was equally embarrassed and pleased, and squirmed and said, “Oh no no no no.” Then she said, “If you ever come back to Reha I would like very much to have love with you, Yude.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I thought you were in love with Sire Zadr!” I blurted out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Oh, I am,” she said, with that eye-roll and melted look they have when they speak of the sires, “aren’t you? Just think of him fucking you, oh! Oh, I get all wet thinking about it!” She smiled and wriggled. I felt embarrassed in my turn and probably showed it. “Don’t you like him?” she inquired with a naivety I found hard to bear. She was acting like a silly adolescent, and I know she’s not a silly adolescent. “But I’ll never be able to afford him,” she said, and sighed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So you want to make do with me, I thought nastily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I’m going to save my money,” she announced after a minute. “I think I want to have a baby next year. Of course I can’t afford Sire Zadr, he’s a Great Champion, but if I don’t go to the Games at Kadaki this year I can save up enough for a really good sire at our fuckery, maybe Master Rosra. I wish, I know this is silly, I’m going to say it anyway, I’ve been wishing you could be its lovemother. I know you can’t, you have to go to the college. I just wanted to tell you. I love you.” She took my hands, drew them to her face, pressed my palms on her eyes for a moment, and then released me. She was smiling, but her tears were on my hands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Oh, Shask,” I said, floored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“It’s all right!” she said. “I have to cry a minute.” And she did. She wept openly, bending over, wringing her hands, and wailing softly. I patted her arm and felt unutterably ashamed of myself. Other passengers looked round and made little sympathetic grunting noises. One old woman said, “That’s it, that’s right, lovey!” In a few minutes Shask stopped crying, wiped her nose and face on her sleeve, drew a long, deep breath, and said, “All right.” She smiled at me. “Driver,” she called, “I have to piss, can we stop?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The driver, a tense-looking woman, growled something, but stopped the bus on the wide, weedy roadside; and Shask and another woman got off and pissed in the weeds. There is an enviable simplicity to many acts in a society which has, in all its daily life, only one gender. And which, perhaps — I don’t know this but it occurred to me then, while I was ashamed of myself — has no shame?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>34/245. (Dictated) Still nothing from Kaza. I think I was right to give him the ansible. I hope he’s in touch with somebody. I wish it was me. I need to know what goes on in the castles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyhow I understand better now what I was seeing at the Games in Reha. There are sixteen adult women for every adult man. One conception in six or so is male, but a lot of nonviable male fetuses and defective male births bring it down to one in sixteen by puberty. My ancestors must have really had fun playing with these people’s chromosomes. I feel guilty, even if it was a million years ago. I have to learn to do without shame but had better not forget the one good use of guilt. Anyhow. A fairly small town like Reha shares its castle with other towns. That confusing spectacle I was taken to on my tenth day down was Awaga Castle trying to keep its place in the Maingame against a castle from up north, and losing. Which means Awaga’s team can’t play in the big game this year in Fadrga, the city south of here, from which the winners go on to compete in the &lt;em>big&lt;/em> big game at Zask, where people come from all over the continent — hundreds of contestants and thousands of spectators. I saw some holos of last year’s Maingame at Zask. There were 1,280 players, the comment said, and forty balls in play. It looked to me like a total mess, my idea of a battle between two unarmed armies, but I gather that great skill and strategy is involved. All the members of the winning team get a special title for the year, and another one for life, and bring glory back to their various castles and the towns that support them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can now get some sense of how this works, see the system from outside it, because the college doesn’t support a castle. People here aren’t obsessed with sports and athletes and sexy sires the way the young women in Reha were, and some of the older ones. It’s a kind of obligatory obsession. Cheer your team, support your brave men, adore your local hero. It makes sense. Given their situation, they need strong, healthy men at their fuckery; it’s social selection reinforcing natural selection. But I’m glad to get away from the rah-rah and the swooning and the posters of fellows with swelling muscles and huge penises and bedroom eyes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have made Resehavanar’s Choice. I chose the option: Less than the truth. Shoggrad and Skodr and the other teachers, professors we’d call them, are intelligent, enlightened people, perfectly capable of understanding the concept of space travel, etc., making decisions about technological innovation, etc. I limit my answers to their questions to technology. I let them assume, as most people naturally assume, particularly people from a monoculture, that our society is pretty much like theirs. When they find how it differs, the effect will be revolutionary, and I have no mandate, reason, or wish to cause such a revolution on Seggri.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their gender imbalance has produced a society in which, as far as I can tell, the men have all the privilege and the women have all the power. It’s obviously a stable arrangement. According to their histories, it’s lasted at least two millennia, and probably in some form or another much longer than that. But it could be quickly and disastrously destabilised by contact with us, by their experiencing the human norm. I don’t know if the men would cling to their privileged status or demand freedom, but surely the women would resist giving up their power, and their sexual system and affectional relationships would break down. Even if they learned to undo the genetic program that was inflicted on them, it would take several generations to restore normal gender distribution. I can’t be the whisper that starts that avalanche.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>34/266. (Dictated) Skodr got nowhere with the men of Awaga Castle. She had to make her inquiries very cautiously, since it would endanger Kaza if she told them he was an alien or in any way unique. They’d take it as a claim of superiority, which he’d have to defend in trials of strength and skill. I gather that the hierarchies within the castles are a rigid framework, within which a man moves up or down issuing challenges and winning or losing obligatory and optional trials. The sports and games the women watch are only the showpieces of an endless series of competitions going on inside the castles. As an untrained, grown man Kaza would be at a total disadvantage in such trials. The only way he might get out of them, she said, would be by feigning illness or idiocy. She thinks he must have done so, since he is at least alive; but that’s all she could find out — “The man who was cast away at Taha-Reha is alive.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the women feed, house, clothe, and support the lords of the castle, they evidently take their noncooperation for granted. She seemed glad to get even that scrap of information. As I am.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But we have to get Kaza out of there. The more I hear about it from Skodr the more dangerous it sounds. I keep thinking “spoiled brats!” but actually these men must be more like soldiers in the training camps that militarists have. Only the training never ends. As they win trials they gain all kinds of titles and ranks you could translate as “generals” and the other names militarists have for all their power-grades. Some of the “generals,” the Lords and Masters and so on, are the sports idols, the darlings of the fuckeries, like the one poor Shask adored; but as they get older apparently they often trade glory among the women for power among the men, and become tyrants within their castle, bossing the “lesser” men around, until they’re overthrown, kicked out. Old sires often live alone, it seems, in little houses away from the main castle, and are considered crazy and dangerous — rogue males.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It sounds like a miserable life. All they’re allowed to do after age eleven is compete at games and sports inside the castle, and compete in the fuckeries, after they’re fifteen or so, for money and number of fucks and so on. Nothing else. No options. No trades. No skills of making. No travel unless they play in the big games. They aren’t allowed into the colleges to gain any kind of freedom of mind. I asked Skodr why an intelligent man couldn’t at least come study in the college, and she told me that learning was very bad for men: it weakens a man’s sense of honor, makes his muscles flabby, and leaves him impotent. ” ‘What goes to the brain takes from the testicles,'” she said. “Men have to be sheltered from education for their own good.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried to “be water,” as I was taught, but I was disgusted. Probably she felt it, because after a while she told me about “the secret college.” Some women in colleges do smuggle information to men in castles. The poor things meet secretly and teach each other. In the castles, homosexual relationships are encouraged among boys under fifteen, but not officially tolerated among grown men; she says the “secret colleges” often are run by the homosexual men. They have to be secret because if they’re caught reading or talking about ideas they may be punished by their Lords and Masters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There have been some interesting works from the “secret colleges,” Skodr said, but she had to think to come up with examples. One was a man who had smuggled out an interesting mathematical theorem, and one was a painter whose landscapes, though primitive in technique, were admired by professionals of the art. She couldn’t remember his name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Arts, sciences, all learning, all professional techniques, are &lt;em>haggyad&lt;/em>, skilled work. They’re all taught at the colleges, and there are no divisions and few specialists. Teachers and students cross and mix fields all the time, and being a famous scholar in one field doesn’t keep you from being a student in another. Skodr is a vev of physiology, writes plays, and is currently studying history with one of the history vevs. Her thinking is informed and lively and fearless. My School on Main could learn from this college. It’s a wonderful place, full of free minds. But only minds of one gender. A hedged freedom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope Kaza has found a secret college or something, some way to fit in at the castle. He’s strong, but these men have trained for years for the games they play. And a lot of the games are violent. The women say don’t worry, we don’t let the men kill each other, we protect them, they’re our treasures. But I’ve seen men carried off with concussions, on the holos of their martial-art fights, where they throw each other around spectacularly. “Only inexperienced fighters get hurt.” Very reassuring. And they wrestle bulls. And in that melee they call the Maingame they break each other’s legs and ankles deliberately. “What’s a hero without a limp?” the women say. Maybe that’s the safe thing to do, get your leg broken so you don’t have to prove you’re a hero any more. But what else might Kaza have to prove?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I asked Shask to let me know if she ever heard of him being at the Reha fuckery. But Awaga Castle services (that’s their word, the same word they use for their bulls) four towns, so he might get sent to one of the others. But probably not, because men who don’t win at things aren’t allowed to go to the fuckeries. Only the champions. And boys between fifteen and nineteen, the ones the older women call &lt;em>dippida&lt;/em>, baby animals — puppy, kitty, lamby. They use the dippida for pleasure. They only pay for a champion when they go to the fuckery to get pregnant. But Kaza’s thirty-six, he isn’t a puppy or a kitten or a lamb. He’s a man, and this is a terrible place to be a man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Kaza Agad had been killed; the Lords of Awaga Castle finally disclosed the fact, but not the circumstances. A year later, Merriment radioed her lander and left Seggri for Hain. Her recommendation was to observe and avoid. The Stabiles, however, decided to send another pair of observers; these were both women, Mobiles Alee Iyoo and Zerin Wu. They lived for eight years on Seggri, after the third year as First Mobiles; Iyoo stayed as Ambassador another fifteen years. They made Resehavanar’s Choice as “all the truth slowly.” A limit of two hundred visitors from off world was set. During the next several generations the people of Seggri, becoming accustomed to the alien presence, considered their own options as members of the Ekumen. Proposals for a planetwide referendum on genetic alteration were abandoned, since the men’s vote would be insignificant unless the women’s vote were handicapped. As of the date of this report the Seggri have not undertaken major genetic alteration, though they have learned and applied various repair techniques, which have resulted in a higher proportion of full-term male infants; the gender balance now stands at about 12:1.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The following is a memoir given to Ambassador Eritho te Ves in 93/1569 by a woman in Ush on Seggri.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You asked me, dear friend, to tell you anything I might like people on other worlds to know about my life and my world. That’s not easy! Do I want anybody anywhere else to know anything about my life? I know how strange we seem to all the others, the half-and-half races; I know they think us backward, provincial, even perverse. Maybe in a few more decades we’ll decide that we should remake ourselves. I won’t be alive then; I don’t think I’d want to be. I like my people. I like our fierce, proud, beautiful men, I don’t want them to become like women. I like our trustful, powerful, generous women, I don’t want them to become like men. And yet I see that among you each man has his own being and nature, each woman has hers, and I can hardly say what it is I think we would lose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was a child I had a brother a year and a half younger than me. His name was Ittu. My mother had gone to the city and paid five years’ savings for my sire, a Master Champion in the Dancing. Ittu’s sire was an old fellow at our village fuckery; they called him “Master Fallback.” He’d never been a champion at anything, hadn’t sired a child for years, and was only too glad to fuck for free. My mother always laughed about it — she was still suckling me, she didn’t even use a preventive, and she tipped him two coppers! When she found herself pregnant she was furious. When they tested and found it was a male fetus she was even more disgusted at having, as they say, to wait for the miscarriage. But when Ittu was born sound and healthy, she gave the old sire two hundred coppers, all the cash she had.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He wasn’t delicate like so many boy babies, but how can you keep from protecting and cherishing a boy? I don’t remember when I wasn’t looking after Ittu, with it all very clear in my head what Little Brother should do and shouldn’t do and all the perils I must keep him from. I was proud of my responsibility, and vain, too, because I had a brother to look after. Not one other motherhouse in my village had a son still living at home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ittu was a lovely child, a star. He had the fleecy soft hair that’s common in my part of Ush, and big eyes; his nature was sweet and cheerful, and he was very bright. The other children loved him and always wanted to play with him, but he and I were happiest playing by ourselves, long elaborate games of make-believe. We had a herd of twelve cattle an old woman of the village had carved from gourd-shell for Ittu — people always gave him presents — and they were the actors in our dearest game. Our cattle lived in a country called Shush, where they had great adventures, climbing mountains, discovering new lands, sailing on rivers, and so on. Like any herd, like our village herd, the old cows were the leaders; the bull lived apart; the other males were gelded; and the heifers were the adventurers. Our bull would make ceremonial visits to service the cows, and then he might have to go fight with men at Shush Castle. We made the castle of clay and the men of sticks, and the bull always won, knocking the stick-men to pieces. Then sometimes he knocked the castle to pieces too. But the best of our stories were told with two of the heifers. Mine was named Op and my brother’s was Utti. Once our hero heifers were having a great adventure on the stream that runs past our village, and their boat got away from us. We found it caught against a log far downstream where the stream was deep and quick. My heifer was still in it. We both dived and dived, but we never found Utti. She had drowned. The Cattle of Shush had a great funeral for her, and Ittu cried very bitterly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He mourned his brave little toy cow so long that I asked Djerdji the cattleherd if we could work for her, because I thought being with the real cattle might cheer Ittu up. She was glad to get two cowhands for free (when Mother found out we were really working, she made Djerdji pay us a quarter-copper a day). We rode two big, goodnatured old cows, on saddles so big Ittu could lie down on his. We took a herd of two-year-old calves out onto the desert every day to forage for the &lt;em>edta&lt;/em> that grows best when it’s grazed. We were supposed to keep them from wandering off and from trampling streambanks, and when they wanted to settle down and chew the cud we were supposed to gather them in a place where their droppings would nourish useful plants. Our old mounts did most of the work. Mother came out and checked on what we were doing and decided it was all right, and being out in the desert all day was certainly keeping us fit and healthy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We loved our riding cows, but they were serious-minded and responsible, rather like the grown-ups in our motherhouse. The calves were something else; they were all riding breed, not fine animals of course, just villagebred; but living on edta they were fat and had plenty of spirit. Ittu and I rode them bareback with a rope rein. At first we always ended up on our own backs watching a calf’s heels and tail flying off. By the end of a year we were good riders, and took to training our mounts to tricks, trading mounts at a full run, and hornvaulting. Ittu was a marvelous hornvaulter. He trained a big three-year-old roan ox with lyre horns, and the two of them danced like the finest vaulters of the great castles that we saw on the holos. We couldn’t keep our excellence to ourselves out in the desert; we started showing off to the other children, inviting them to come out to Salt Springs to see our Great Trick Riding Show. And so of course the adults got to hear of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mother was a brave woman, but that was too much for even her, and she said to me in cold fury, “I trusted you to look after Ittu. You let me down.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the others had been going on and on about endangering the precious life of a boy, the Vial of Hope, the Treasurehouse of Life, and so on, but it was what my mother said that hurt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I do look after Ittu, and he looks after me,” I said to her, in that passion of justice that children know, the birthright we seldom honor. “We both know what’s dangerous and we don’t do stupid things and we know our cattle and we do everything together. When he has to go to the castle he’ll have to do lots more dangerous things, but at least he’ll already know how to do one of them. And there he has to do them alone, but we did everything together. And I didn’t let you down.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mother looked at us. I was nearly twelve, Ittu was ten. She burst into tears, she sat down on the dirt and wept aloud. Ittu and I both went to her and hugged her and cried. Ittu said, “I won’t go. I won’t go to the damned castle. They can’t make me!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I believed him. He believed himself. My mother knew better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe some day it will be possible for a boy to choose his life. Among your peoples a man’s body does not shape his fate, does it? Maybe some day that will be so here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our Castle, Hidjegga, had of course been keeping their eye on Ittu ever since he was born; once a year Mother would send them the doctor’s report on him, and when he was five Mother and her wives took him out there for the ceremony of Confirmation. Ittu had been embarrassed, disgusted, and flattered. He told me in secret, “There were all these old &lt;em>men&lt;/em> that smelled funny and they made me take off my clothes and they had these measuring things and they measured my peepee! And they said it was very good. They said it was a good one. What happens when you descend?” It wasn’t the first question he had ever asked me that I couldn’t answer, and as usual I made up the answer. “Descend means you can have babies,” I said, which, in a way, wasn’t so far off the mark.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some castles, I am told, prepare boys of nine and ten for the Severance, woo them with visits from older boys, tickets to games, tours of the park and the buildings, so that they may be quite eager to go to the castle when they turn eleven. But we “outyonders,” villagers of the edge of the desert, kept to the harsh old-fashioned ways. Aside from Confirmation, a boy had no contact at all with men until his eleventh birthday. On that day everybody he had ever known brought him to the Gate and gave him to the strangers with whom he would live the rest of his life. Men and women alike believed and still believe that this absolute severance makes the man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vev Ushiggi, who had borne a son and had a grandson, and had been mayor five or six times, and was held in great esteem even though she’d never had much money, heard Ittu say that he wouldn’t go to the damned Castle. She came next day to our motherhouse and asked to talk to him. He told me what she said. She didn’t do any wooing or sweetening. She told him that he was born to the service of his people and had one responsibility, to sire children when he got old enough; and one duty, to be a strong, brave man, stronger and braver than other men, so that women would choose him to sire their children. She said he had to live in the Castle because men could not live among women. At this, Ittu asked her, “Why can’t they?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“You did?” I said, awed by his courage, for Vev Ushiggi was a formidable old woman.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Yes. And she didn’t really answer. She took a long time. She looked at me and then she looked off somewhere and then she stared at me for a long time and then finally she said, ‘Because we would destroy them.’ ”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“But that’s crazy,” I said. “Men are our treasures. What did she say that for?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ittu, of course, didn’t know. But he thought hard about what she had said, and I think nothing she could have said would have so impressed him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After discussion, the village elders and my mother and her wives decided that Ittu could go on practicing hornvaulting, because it really would be a useful skill for him in the Castle; but he could not herd cattle any longer, nor go with me when I did, nor join in any of the work children of the village did, nor their games. “You’ve done everything together with Po,” they told him, “but she should be doing things together with the other girls, and you should be doing things by yourself, the way men do.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They were always very kind to Ittu, but they were stern with us girls; if they saw us even talking with Ittu they’d tell us to go on about our work, leave the boy alone. When we disobeyed — when Ittu and I sneaked off and met at Salt Springs to ride together, or just hid out in our old playplace down in the draw by the stream to talk — he got treated with cold silence to shame him, but I got punished. A day locked in the cellar of the old fiber-processing mill, which was what my village used for a jail; next time it was two days; and the third time they caught us alone together, they locked me in that cellar for ten days. A young woman called Fersk brought me food once a day and made sure I had enough water and wasn’t sick, but she didn’t speak; that’s how they always used to punish people in the villages. I could hear the other children going by up on the street in the evening. It would get dark at last and I could sleep. All day I had nothing to do, no work, nothing to think about except the scorn and contempt they held me in for betraying their trust, and the injustice of my getting punished when Ittu didn’t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I came out, I felt different. I felt like something had closed up inside me while I was closed up in that cellar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we ate at the motherhouse they made sure Ittu and I didn’t sit near each other. For a while we didn’t even talk to each other. I went back to school and work. I didn’t know what Ittu was doing all day. I didn’t think about it. It was only fifty days to his birthday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One night I got into bed and found a note under my clay pillow: &lt;em>in the draw to-nt&lt;/em>. Ittu never could spell; what writing he knew I had taught him in secret. I was frightened and angry, but I waited an hour till everybody was asleep, and got up and crept outside into the windy, starry night, and ran to the draw. It was late in the dry season and the stream was barely running. Ittu was there, hunched up with his arms round his knees, a little lump of shadow on the pale, cracked clay at the waterside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing I said was, “You want to get me locked up again? They said next time it would be thirty days!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“They’re going to lock me up for fifty years,” Ittu said, not looking at me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“What am I supposed to do about it? It’s the way it has to be! You’re a man. You have to do what men do. They won’t lock you up, anyway, you get to play games and come to town to do service and all that. You don’t even know what being locked up is!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I want to go to Seradda,” Ittu said, talking very fast, his eyes shining as he looked up at me. “We could take the riding cows to the bus station in Redang, I saved my money, I have twenty-three coppers, we could take the bus to Seradda. The cows would come back home if we turned them loose.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“What do you think you’d do in Seradda?” I asked, disdainful but curious. Nobody from our village had ever been to the capital.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“The Ekkamen people are there,” he said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“The Ekumen,” I corrected him. “So what?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“They could take me away,” Ittu said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I felt very strange when he said that. I was still angry and still disdainful but a sorrow was rising in me like dark water. “Why would they do that? What would they talk to some little boy for? How would you find them? Twenty-three coppers isn’t enough anyway. Seradda’s way far off. That’s a really stupid idea. You can’t do that.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I thought you’d come with me,” Ittu said. His voice was softer, but didn’t shake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I wouldn’t do a stupid thing like that,” I said furiously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“All right,” he said. “But you won’t tell. Will you?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“No, I won’t tell!” I said. “But you can’t run away, Ittu. You can’t. It would be — it would be dishonorable.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time when he answered his voice shook. “I don’t care,” he said. “I don’t care about honor. I want to be free!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were both in tears. I sat down by him and we leaned together the way we used to, and cried a while; not long; we weren’t used to crying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“You can’t do it,” I whispered to him. “It won’t work, Ittu.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He nodded, accepting my wisdom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“It won’t be so bad at the Castle,” I said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a minute he drew away from me very slightly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“We’ll see each other,” I said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He said only, “When?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“At games. I can watch you. I bet you’ll be the best rider and hornvaulter there. I bet you win all the prizes and get to be a Champion.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He nodded, dutiful. He knew and I knew that I had betrayed our love and our birthright of justice. He knew he had no hope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was the last time we talked together alone, and almost the last time we talked together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ittu ran away about ten days after that, taking the riding cow and heading for Redang; they tracked him easily and had him back in the village before nightfall. I don’t know if he thought I had told them where he would be going. I was so ashamed of not having gone with him that I could not look at him. I kept away from him; they didn’t have to keep me away any more. He made no effort to speak to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was beginning my puberty, and my first blood was the night before Ittu’s birthday. Menstruating women are not allowed to come near the Gates at conservative castles like ours, so when Ittu was made a man I stood far back among a few other girls and women, and could not see much of the ceremony. I stood silent while they sang, and looked down at the dirt and my new sandals and my feet in the sandals, and felt the ache and tug of my womb and the secret movement of the blood, and grieved. I knew even then that this grief would be with me all my life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ittu went in and the Gates closed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He became a Young Champion Hornvaulter, and for two years, when he was eighteen and nineteen, came a few times to service in our village, but I never saw him. One of my friends fucked with him and started to tell me about it, how nice he was, thinking I’d like to hear, but I shut her up and walked away in a blind rage which neither of us understood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He was traded away to a castle on the east coast when he was twenty. When my daughter was born I wrote him, and several times after that, but he never answered my letters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t know what I’ve told you about my life and my world. I don’t know if it’s what I want you to know. It is what I had to tell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The following is a short story -written in 93/1586 by a popular writer of the city of Adr, Sem Gridji. The classic literature of Seggri was the narrative poem and the drama. Classical poems and plays were written collaboratively, in the original version and also by re-writers of subsequent generations, usually anonymous. Small value was placed on preserving a “true” text, since the work was seen as an ongoing process. Probably under Ekumenical influence, individual writers in the late sixteenth century began writing short prose narratives, historical and fictional. The genre became popular, particularly in the cities, though it never obtained the immense audience of the great classical epics and plays. Literally everyone knew the plots and many quotations from the epics and plays, from books and holo, and almost every adult woman had seen or participated in a staged performance of several of them. They were one of the principal unifying influences of the Seggrian monoculture. The prose narrative, read in silence, served rather as a device by which the culture might question itself, and a tool for individual moral self-examination. Conservative Seggrian women disapproved of the genre as antagonistic to the intensely cooperative, collaborative structure of their society. Fiction was not included in the curriculum of the literature departments of the colleges, and was often dismissed contemptuously&lt;/em> — “&lt;em>fiction is for men&lt;/em>.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Sem Gridji published three books of stories. Her bare, blunt style is characteristic of the Seggrian short story.&lt;/em> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>LOVE OUT OF PLACE by Sem Gridji&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azak grew up in a motherhouse in the Downriver Quarter, near the textile mills. She was a bright girl, and her family and neighborhood were proud to gather the money to send her to college. She came back to the city as a starting manager at one of the mills. Azak worked well with other people; she prospered. She had a clear idea of what she wanted to do in the next few years: to find two or three partners with whom to found a daughterhouse and a business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A beautiful woman in the prime of youth, Azak took great pleasure in sex, especially liking intercourse with men. Though she saved money for her plan of founding a business, she also spent a good deal at the fuckery, going there often, sometimes hiring two men at once. She liked to see how they incited each other to prowess beyond what they would have achieved alone, and shamed each other when they failed. She found a flaccid penis very disgusting, and did not hesitate to send away a man who could not penetrate her three or four times an evening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The castle of her district bought a Young Champion at the Southeast Castles Dance Tournament, and soon sent him to the fuckery. Having seen him dance in the finals on the holovision and been captivated by his flowing, graceful style and his beauty, Azak was eager to have him service her. His price was twice that of any other man there, but she did not hesitate to pay it. She found him handsome and amiable, eager and gentle, skillful and compliant. In their first evening they came to orgasm together five times. When she left she gave him a large tip. Within the week she was back, asking for Toddra. The pleasure he gave her was exquisite, and soon she was quite obsessed with him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I wish I had you all to myself,” she said to him one night as they lay still conjoined, languorous and fulfilled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“That is my heart’s desire,” he said. “I wish I were your servant. None of the other women that come here arouse me. I don’t want them. I want only you.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She wondered if he was telling the truth. The next time she came, she inquired casually of the manager if Toddra were as popular as they had hoped. “No,” the manager said. “Everybody else reports that he takes a lot of arousing, and is sullen and careless towards them.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“How strange,” Azak said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Not at all,” said the manager. “He’s in love with you.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“A man in love with a woman?” Azak said, and laughed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“It happens all too often,” the manager said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I thought only women fell in love,” said Azak.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Women fall in love with a man, sometimes, and that’s bad too,” said the manager. “May I warn you, Azak? Love should be between women. It’s out of place here. It can never come to any good end. I hate to lose the money, but I wish you’d fuck with some of the other men and not always ask for Toddra. You’re encouraging him, you see, in something that does harm to him.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“But he and you are making lots of money from me!” said Azak, still taking it as a joke.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“He’d make more from other women if he wasn’t in love with you,” said the manager. To Azak that seemed a weak argument against the pleasure she had in Toddra, and she said, “Well, he can fuck them all when I’ve done with him, but for now, I want him.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After their intercourse that evening, she said to Toddra, “The manager here says you’re in love with me.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I told you I was,” Toddra said. “I told you I wanted to belong to you, to serve you, you alone. I would die for you, Azak.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“That’s foolish,” she said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Don’t you like me? Don’t I please you?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“More than any man I ever knew,” she said, kissing him. “You are beautiful and utterly satisfying, my sweet Toddra.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“You don’t want any of the other men here, do you?” he asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“No. They’re all ugly fumblers, compared to my beautiful dancer.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Listen, then,” he said, sitting up and speaking very seriously. He was a slender man of twenty-two, with long, smooth-muscled limbs, wide-set eyes, and a thin-lipped, sensitive mouth. Azak lay stroking his thigh, thinking how lovely and lovable he was. “I have a plan,” he said. “When I dance, you know, in the story-dances, I play a woman, of course; I’ve done it since I was twelve. People always say they can’t believe I really am a man, I play a woman so well. If I escaped — from here, from the Castle — as a woman — I could come to your house as a servant — ”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“What?” cried Azak, astounded.“I could live there,” he said urgently, bending over her. “With you. I would always be there. You could have me every night. It would cost you nothing, except my food. I would serve you, service you, sweep your house, do anything, anything, Azak, please, my beloved, my mistress, let me be yours!” He saw that she was still incredulous, and hurried on, “You could send me away when you got tired of me — ”“If you tried to go back to the Castle after an escapade like that they’d whip you to death, you idiot!”“I’m valuable,” he said. “They’d punish me, but they wouldn’t damage me.”“You’re wrong. You haven’t been dancing, and your value here has slipped because you don’t perform well with anybody but me. The manager told me so.”Tears stood in Toddra’s eyes. Azak disliked giving him pain, but she was genuinely shocked at his wild plan. “And if you were discovered, my dear,” she said more gently, “I would be utterly disgraced. It is a very childish plan, Toddra. Please never dream of such a thing again. But I am truly, truly fond of you, I adore you and want no other man but you. Do you believe that, Toddra?”He nodded. Restraining his tears, he said, “For now.”“For now and for a long, long, long time! My dear, sweet, beautiful dancer, we have each other as long as we want, years and years! Only do your duty by the other women that come, so that you don’t get sold away by your Castle, please! I couldn’t bear to lose you, Toddra.” And she clasped him passionately in her arms, and arousing him at once, opened to him, and soon both were crying out in the throes of delight.Though she could not take his love entirely seriously, since what could come of such a misplaced emotion, except such foolish schemes as he had proposed? — still he touched her heart, and she felt a tenderness towards him that greatly enhanced the pleasure of their intercourse. So for more than a year she spent two or three nights a week with him at the fuckery, which was as much as she could afford. The manager, trying still to discourage his love, would not lower Toddra’s fee, even though he was unpopular among the other clients of the fuckery; so Azak spent a great deal of money on him, although he would never, after the first night, accept a tip from her.Then a woman who had not been able to conceive with any of the sires at the fuckery tried Toddra, and at once conceived, and being tested found the fetus to be male. Another woman conceived by him, again a male fetus. At once Toddra was in demand as a sire. Women began coming from all over the city to be serviced by him. This meant, of course, that he must be free during their period of ovulation. There were now many evenings that he could not meet Azak, for the manager was not to be bribed. Toddra disliked his popularity, but Azak soothed and reassured him, telling him how proud she was of him, and how his work would never interfere with their love. In fact, she was not altogether sorry that he was so much in demand, for she had found another person with whom she wanted to spend her evenings.This was a young woman named Zedr, who worked in the mill as a machine-repair specialist. She was tall and handsome; Azak noticed first how freely and strongly she walked and how proudly she stood. She found a pretext to make her acquaintance. It seemed to Azak that Zedr admired her; but for a long time each behaved to the other as a friend only, making no sexual advances. They were much in each other’s company, going to games and dances together, and Azak found that she enjoyed this open and sociable life better than always being in the fuckery alone with Toddra. They talked about how they might set up a machine-repair service in partnership. As time went on, Azak found that Zedr’s beautiful body was always in her thoughts. At last, one evening in her singlewoman’s flat, she told her friend that she loved her, but did not wish to burden their friendship with an unwelcome desire.Zedr replied, “I have wanted you ever since I first saw you, but I didn’t want to embarrass you with my desire. I thought you preferred men.”“Until now I did, but I want to make love with you,” Azak said.She found herself quite timid at first, but Zedr was expert and subtle, and could prolong Azak’s orgasms till she found such consummation as she had not dreamed of. She said to Zedr, “You have made me a woman.”“Then let’s make each other wives,” said Zedr joyfully.They married, moved to a house in the west of the city, and left the mill, setting up in business together.All this time, Azak had said nothing of her new love to Toddra, whom she had seen less and less often. A little ashamed of her cowardice, she reassured herself that he was so busy performing as a sire that he would not really miss her. After all, despite his romantic talk of love, he was a man, and to a man fucking is the most important thing, instead of being merely one element of love and life as it is to a woman.When she married Zedr, she sent Toddra a letter, saying that their lives had drifted apart, and she was now moving away and would not see him again, but would always remember him fondly.She received an immediate answer from Toddra, a letter begging her to come and talk with him, full of avowals of unchanging love, badly spelled and almost illegible. The letter touched, embarrassed, and shamed her, and she did not answer it.He wrote again and again, and tried to reach her on the holonet at her new business. Zedr urged her not to make any response, saying, “It would be cruel to encourage him.”Their new business went well from the start. They were home one evening busy chopping vegetables for dinner when there was a knock at the door. “Come in,” Zedr called, thinking it was Chochi, a friend they were considering as a third partner. A stranger entered, a tall, beautiful woman with a scarf over her hair. The stranger went straight to Azak, saying in a strangled voice, “Azak, Azak, please, please let me stay with you.” The scarf fell back from his long hair. Azak recognised Toddra.She was astonished and a little frightened, but she had known Toddra a long time and been very fond of him, and this habit of affection made her put out her hands to him in greeting. She saw fear and despair in his face, and was sorry for him.But Zedr, guessing who he was, was both alarmed and angry. She kept the chopping knife in her hand. She slipped from the room and called the city police.When she returned she saw the man pleading with Azak to let him stay hidden in their household as a servant. “I will do anything,” he said. “Please, Azak, my only love, please! I can’t live without you. I can’t service those women, those strangers who only want to be impregnated. I can’t dance any more. I think only of you, you are my only hope. I will be a woman, no one will know. I’ll cut my hair, no one will know!” So he went on, almost threatening in his passion, but pitiful also. Zedr listened coldly, thinking he was mad. Azak listened with pain and shame. “No, no, it is not possible,” she said over and over, but he would not hear.When the police came to the door and he realized who they were, he bolted to the back of the house seeking escape. The policewomen caught him in the bedroom; he fought them desperately, and they subdued him brutally. Azak shouted at them not to hurt him, but they paid no heed, twisting his arms and hitting him about the head till he stopped resisting. They dragged him out. The chief of the troop stayed to take evidence. Azak tried to plead for Toddra, but Zedr stated the facts and added that she thought he was insane and dangerous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After some days, Azak inquired at the police office and was told that Toddra had been returned to his Castle with a warning not to send him to the fuckery again for a year or until the Lords of the Castle found him capable of responsible behavior. She was uneasy thinking of how he might be punished. Zedr said, “They won’t hurt him, he’s too valuable,” just as he himself had said. Azak was glad to believe this. She was, in fact, much relieved to know that he was out of the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She and Zedr took Chochi first into their business and then into their household. Chochi was a woman from the dockside quarter, tough and humorous, a hard worker and an undemanding, comfortable lovemaker. They were happy with one another, and prospered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A year went by, and another year. Azak went to her old quarter to arrange a contract for repair work with two women from the mill where she had first worked. She asked them about Toddra. He was back at the fuckery from time to time, they told her. He had been named the year’s Champion Sire of his Castle, and was much in demand, bringing an even higher price, because he impregnated so many women and so many of the conceptions were male. He was not in demand for pleasure, they said, as he had a reputation for roughness and even cruelty. Women asked for him only if they wanted to conceive. Thinking of his gentleness with her, Azak found it hard to imagine him behaving brutally. Harsh punishment at the Castle, she thought, must have altered him. But she could not believe that he had truly changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another year passed. The business was doing very well, and Azak and Chochi both began talking seriously about having children. Zedr was not interested in bearing, though happy to be a mother.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chochi had a favorite man at their local fuckery to whom she went now and then for pleasure; she began going to him at ovulation, for he had a good reputation as a sire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azak had not been to a fuckery since she and Zedr married. She honored fidelity highly, and made love with no one but Zedr and Chochi. When she thought of being impregnated, she found that her old interest in fucking with men had quite died out or even turned to distaste. She did not like the idea of self-impregnation from the sperm bank, but the idea of letting a strange man penetrate her was even, more repulsive. Thinking what to do, she thought of Toddra, whom she had truly loved and had pleasure with. He was again a Champion Sire, known throughout the city as a reliable impregnator. There was certainly no other man with whom she could take any pleasure. And he had loved her so much he had put his career and even his life in danger, trying to be with her. That irresponsibility was over and done with. He had never written to her again, and the Castle and the managers of the fuckery would never have let him service women if they thought him mad or untrustworthy. After all this time, she thought, she could go back to him and give him the pleasure he had so desired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She notified the fuckery of the expected period of her next ovulation, requesting Toddra. He was already engaged for that period, and they offered her another sire; but she preferred to wait till the next month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chochi had conceived, and was elated. “Hurry up, hurry up!” she said to Azak. “We want twins!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Azak found herself looking forward to being with Toddra. Regretting the violence of their last encounter and the pain it must have given him, she wrote the following letter to him:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>“My dear, I hope our long separation and the distress of our last meeting will be forgotten in the joy of being together again, and that you still love me as I still love you. I shall be very proud to bear your child, and let us hope it may be a son! I am impatient to see you again, my beautiful dancer. Your Azak.”&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There had not been time for him to answer this letter when her ovulation period began. She dressed in her best clothes. Zedr still distrusted Toddra and had tried to dissuade her from going to him; she bade her “Good luck!” rather sulkily. Chochi hung a mother-charm around her neck, and she went off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was a new manager on duty at the fuckery, a coarse-faced young woman who told her, “Call out if he gives you any trouble. He may be a Champion but he’s rough, and we don’t let him get away with hurting anybody.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“He won’t hurt me,” Azak said, smiling, and went eagerly into the familiar room where she and Toddra had enjoyed each other so often. He was standing waiting at the window just as he had used to stand. When he turned he looked just as she remembered, long-limbed, his silky hair flowing like water down his back, his wide-set eyes gazing at her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Toddra!” she said, coming to him with outstretched hands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He took her hands and said her name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Did you get my letter? Are you happy?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Yes,” he said, smiling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“And all that unhappiness, all that foolishness about love, is it over? I am so sorry you were hurt, Toddra, I don’t want any more of that. Can we just be ourselves and be happy together as we used to be?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Yes, all that is over,” he said. “And I am happy to see you.” He drew her gently to him. Gently he began to undress her and caress her body, just as he had used to, knowing what gave her pleasure, and she remembering what gave him pleasure. They lay down naked together. She was fondling his erect penis, aroused and yet a little reluctant to be penetrated after so long, when he moved his arm as if uncomfortable. Drawing away from him a little, she saw that he had a knife in his hand, which he must have hidden in the bed. He was holding it concealed behind his back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her womb went cold, but she continued to fondle his penis and testicles, not daring to say anything and not able to pull away, for he was holding her close with the other hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suddenly he moved onto her and forced his penis into her vagina with a thrust so painful that for an instant she thought it was the knife. He ejaculated instantly. As his body arched she writhed out from under him, scrambled to the door, and ran from the room crying for help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He pursued her, striking with the knife, stabbing her in the shoulderblade before the manager and other women and men seized him. The men were very angry and treated him with a violence which the manager’s protests did not lessen. Naked, bloody, and half-conscious, he was bound and taken away immediately to the Castle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everyone now gathered around Azak, and her wound, which was slight, was cleaned and covered. Shaken and confused, she could ask only, “What will they do to him?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“What do you think they do to a murdering rapist? Give him a prize?” the manager said. “They’ll geld him.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“But it was my fault,” Azak said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The manager stared at her and said, “Are you mad? Go home.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She went back into the room and mechanically put on her clothes. She looked at the bed where they had lain. She stood at the window where Toddra had stood. She remembered how she had seen him dance long ago in the contest where he had first been made champion. She thought, “My life is wrong.” But she did not know how to make it right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Alteration in Seggrian social and cultural institutions did not take the disastrous course Merriment feared. It has been slow and its direction is not clear. In 93/1602 Terhada College invited men from two neighboring castles to apply as students, and three men did so. In the next decades, most colleges opened their doors to men. Once they were graduated, male students had to return to their castle, unless they left the planet, since native men were not allowed to live anywhere but as students in a college or in a castle, until the Open Gate Law was passed in 93/1662.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Even after passage of that law, the castles remained closed to women; and the exodus of men from the castles was much slower than opponents of the measure feared. Social adjustment to the Open Gate Law has been slow. In several regions programs to train men in basic skills such as farming and construction have met with moderate success; the men work in competitive teams, separate from and managed by the women’s companies. A good many Seggri have come to Main to study in recent years&lt;/em> — &lt;em>more men than women, despite the great numerical imbalance that still exists&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The following autobiographical sketch by one of these men is of particular interest, since he was involved in the event which directly precipitated the Open Gate Law.&lt;/em> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH BY MOBILE ARDAR DEZ&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was born in Ekumenical Cycle 93, Year 1641, in Rakedr on Seggri. Rakedr was a placid, prosperous, conservative town, and I was brought up in the old way, the petted boychild of a big motherhouse. Altogether there were seventeen of us, not counting the kitchen staff — a great-grandmother, two grandmothers, four mothers, nine daughters, and me. We were well off; all the women were or had been managers or skilled workers in the Rakedr Pottery, the principal industry of the town. We kept all the holidays with pomp and energy, decorating the house from roof to foundation with banners for Hillalli, making fantastic costumes for the Harvest Festival, and celebrating somebody’s birthday every few weeks with gifts all round. I was petted, as I said, but not, I think, spoiled. My birthday was no grander than my sisters’, and I was allowed to run and play with them just as if I were a girl. Yet I was always aware, as were they, that our mothers’ eyes rested on me with a different look, brooding, reserved, and sometimes, as I grew older, desolate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After my Confirmation, my birthmother or her mother took me to Rakedr Castle every spring on Visiting Day. The gates of the park, which had opened to admit me alone (and terrified) for my Confirmation, remained shut, but rolling stairs were placed against the park walls. Up these I and a few other little boys from the town climbed, to sit on top of the park wall in great state, on cushions, under awnings, and watch demonstration dancing, bull-dancing, wrestling, and other sports on the great gamefield inside the wall. Our mothers waited below, outside, in the bleachers of the public field. Men and youths from the Castle sat with us, explaining the rules of the games and pointing out the fine points of a dancer or wrestler, treating us seriously, making us feel important. I enjoyed that very much, but as soon as I came down off the wall and started home it all fell away like a costume shrugged off, a part played in a play; and I went on with my work and play in the motherhouse with my family, my real life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was ten I went to Boys’ Class downtown. The class had been set up forty or fifty years before as a bridge between the motherhouses and the Castle, but the Castle, under increasingly reactionary governance, had recently withdrawn from the project. Lord Fassaw forbade his men to go anywhere outside the walls but directly to the fuckery, in a closed car, returning at first light; and so no men were able to teach the class. The townswomen who tried to tell me what to expect when I went to the Castle did not really know much more than I did. However well-meaning they were, they mostly frightened and confused me. But fear and confusion were an appropriate preparation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I cannot describe the ceremony of Severance. I really cannot describe it. Men on Seggri, in those days, had this advantage: they knew what death is. They had all died once before their body’s death. They had turned and looked back at their whole life, every place and face they had loved, and turned away from it as the gate closed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the time of my Severance, our small Castle was internally divided into “collegials” and “traditionals,” a liberal faction left from the regime of Lord Ishog and a younger, highly conservative faction. The split was already disastrously wide when I came to the Castle. Lord Fassaw’s rule had grown increasingly harsh and irrational. He governed by corruption, brutality, and cruelty. All of us who lived there were of course infected, and would have been destroyed if there had not been a strong, constant, moral resistance, centered around Ragaz and Kohadrat, who had been proteges of Lord Ishog. The two men were open partners; their followers were all the homosexuals in the Castle, and a good number of other men and older boys.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first days and months in the Scrubs’ dormitory were a bewildering alternation: terror, hatred, shame, as the boys who had been there a few months or years longer than I were incited to humiliate and abuse the newcomer, in order to make a man of him — and comfort, gratitude, love, as boys who had come under the influence of the collegials offered me secret friendship and protection. They helped me in the games and competitions and took me into their beds at night, not for sex but to keep me from the sexual bullies. Lord Fassaw detested adult homosexuality and would have reinstituted the death penalty if the Town Council had allowed it. Though he did not dare punish Ragaz and Kohadrat, he punished consenting love between older boys with bizarre and appalling physical mutilations — ears cut into fringes, fingers branded with red-hot iron rings. Yet he encouraged the older boys to rape the eleven- and twelve-year-olds, as a manly practice. None of us escaped. We particularly dreaded four youths, seventeen or eighteen years old when I came there, who called themselves the Lordsmen. Every few nights they raided the Scrubs’ dormitory for a victim, whom they raped as a group. The collegials protected us as best they could by ordering us to their beds, where we wept and protested loudly, while they pretended to abuse us, laughing and jeering. Later, in the dark and silence, they comforted us with candy, and sometimes, as we grew older, with a desired love, gentle and exquisite in its secrecy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was no privacy at all in the Castle. I have said that to women who asked me to describe life there, and they thought they understood me. “Well, everybody shares everything in a motherhouse,” they would say, “everybody’s in and out of the rooms all the time. You’re never really alone unless you have a singlewoman’s flat.” I could not tell them how different the loose, warm commonality of the motherhouse was from the rigid, deliberate publicity of the forty-bed, brightly-lighted Castle dormitories. Nothing in Rakedr was private: only secret, only silent. We ate our tears.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I grew up; I take some pride in that, along with my profound gratitude to the boys and men who made it possible. I did not kill myself, as several boys did during those years, nor did I kill my mind and soul, as some did so their body could survive. Thanks to the maternal care of the collegials — the resistance, as we came to call ourselves — I grew up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why do I say maternal, not paternal? Because there were no fathers in my world. There were only sires. I knew no such word as father or paternal. I thought of Ragaz and Kohadrat as my mothers. I still do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fassaw grew quite mad as the years went on, and his hold over the Castle tightened to a deathgrip. The Lordsmen now ruled us all. They were lucky in that we still had a strong Maingame team, the pride of Fassaw’s heart, which kept us in the First League, as well as two Champion Sires in steady demand at the town fuckeries. Any protest the resistance tried to bring to the Town Council could be dismissed as typical male whining, or laid to the demoralizing influence of the aliens. From the outside Rakedr Castle seemed all right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Look at our great team! Look at our champion studs! The women looked no further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How could they abandon us? — the cry every Seggrian boy must make in his heart. How could she leave me here? Doesn’t she know what it’s like? Why doesn’t she know? Doesn’t she want to know?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Of course not,” Ragaz said to me when I came to him in a passion of righteous indignation, the Town Council having denied our petition to be heard. “Of course they don’t want to know how we live. Why do they never come into the castles? Oh, we keep them out, yes; but do you think we could keep them out if they wanted to enter? My dear, we collude with them and they with us in maintaining the great foundation of ignorance and lies on which our civilization rests.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Our own mothers abandon us,” I said.“Abandon us? Who feeds us, clothes us, houses us, pays us? We’re utterly dependent on them. If ever we made ourselves independent, perhaps we could rebuild society on a foundation of truth.”Independence was as far as his vision could reach. Yet I think his mind groped further, towards what he could not see, the body’s obscure, inalterable dream of mutuality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our effort to make our case heard at the Council had no effect except within the Castle. Lord Fassaw saw his power threatened. Within a few days Ragaz was seized by the Lordsmen and their bully boys, accused of repeated homosexual acts and treasonable plots, arraigned, and sentenced by the Lord of the Castle. Everyone was summoned to the Gamefield to witness the punishment. A man of fifty with a heart ailment — he had been a Maingame racer in his twenties and had overtrained — Ragaz was tied naked across a bench and beaten with “Lord Long,” a heavy leather tube filled with lead weights. The Lordsman Berhed, who wielded it, struck repeatedly at the head, the kidneys, and the genitals. Ragaz died an hour or two later in the infirmary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Rakedr Mutiny took shape that night. Kohadrat, older than Ragaz and devastated by his loss, could not restrain or guide us. His vision had been of a true resistance, longlasting and nonviolent, through which the Lordsmen would in time destroy themselves. We had been following that vision. Now we let it go. We dropped the truth and grabbed weapons. “How you play is what you win,” Kohadrat said, but we had heard all those old saws. We would not play the patience game any more. We would win, now, once for all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we did. We won. We had our victory. Lord Fassaw, the Lordsmen and their bullies had been slaughtered by the time the police got to the Gate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember how those tough women strode in among us, staring at the rooms of the Castle which they had never seen, staring at the mutilated bodies, eviscerated, castrated, headless — at Lordsman Berhepl, who had been nailed to the floor with “Lord Long” stuffed down his throat — at us, the rebels, the victors, with our bloody hands and defiant faces — at Kohadrat, whom we thrust forward as our leader, our spokesman.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He stood silent. He ate his tears.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The women drew closer to one another, clutching their guns, staring around. They were appalled, they thought us all insane. Their utter incomprehension drove one of us at last to speak — a young man, Tarsk, who wore the iron ring that had been forced onto his finger when it was red-hot. “They killed Ragaz,” he said. “They were all mad. Look.” He held out his crippled hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The chief of the troop, after a pause, said, “No one will leave here till this is looked into,” and marched her women out of the Castle, out of the park, locking the gate behind them, leaving us with our victory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The hearings and judgments on the Rakedr Mutiny were all broadcast, of course, and the event has been studied and discussed ever since. My own part in it was the murder of the Lordsman Tatiddi. Three of us set on him and beat him to death with exercise-clubs in the gymnasium where we had cornered him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How we played was what we won.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were not punished. Men were sent from several castles to form a government over Rakedr Castle. They learned enough of Fassaw’s behavior to see the cause of our rebellion, but the contempt of even the most liberal of them for us was absolute. They treated us not as men, but as irrational, irresponsible creatures, untamable cattle. If we spoke they did not answer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do not know how long we could have endured that cold regime of shame. It was only two months after the Mutiny that the World Council enacted the Open Gate Law. We told one another that that was our victory, we had made that happen. None of us believed it. We told one another we were free. For the first time in history, any man who wanted to leave his castle could walk out the gate. We were free!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What happened to the free man outside the gate? Nobody had given it much thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was one who walked out the gate, on the morning of the day the law came into force. Eleven of us walked into town together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Several of us, men not from Rakedr, went to one or another of the fuckeries, hoping to be allowed to stay there; they had nowhere else to go. Hotels and inns of course would not accept men. Those of us who had been children in the town went to our motherhouses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is it like to return from the dead? Not easy. Not for the one who returns, nor for his people. The place he occupied in their world has closed up, ceased to be, filled with accumulated change, habit, the doings and needs of others. He has been replaced. To return from the dead is to be a ghost: a person for whom there is no room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neither I nor my family understood that, at first. I came back to them at twenty-one as trustingly as if I were the eleven-year-old who had left them, and they opened their arms to their child. But he did not exist. Who was I?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a long time, months, we refugees from the Castle hid in our motherhouses. The men from other towns all made their way home, usually by begging a ride with teams on tour. There were seven or eight of us in Rakedr, but we scarcely ever saw one another. Men had no place on the street; for hundreds of years a man seen alone on the street had been arrested immediately. If we went out, women ran from us, or reported us, or surrounded and threatened us — “Get back into your Castle where you belong! Get back to the fuckery where you belong! Get out of our city!” They called us drones, and in fact we had no work, no function at all in the community. The fuckeries would not accept us for service, because we had no guarantee of health and good behavior from a castle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was our freedom: we were all ghosts, useless, frightened, frightening intruders, shadows in the corners of life. We watched life going on around us — work, love, childbearing, childrearing, getting and spending, making and shaping, governing and adventuring — the women’s world, the bright, full, real world — and there was no room in it for us. All we had ever learned to do was play games and destroy one another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mothers and sisters racked their brains, I know, to find some place and use for me in their lively, industrious household. Two old live-in cooks had run our kitchen since long before I was born, so cooking, the one practical art I had been taught in the Castle, was superfluous. They found household tasks for me, but they were all make-work, and they and I knew it. I was perfectly willing to look after the babies, but one of the grandmothers was very jealous of that privilege, and also some of my sisters’ wives were uneasy about a man touching their baby. My sister Pado broached the possibility of an apprenticeship in the clayworks, and I leaped at the chance; but the managers of the Pottery, after long discussion, were unable to agree to accept men as employees. Their hormones would make male workers unreliable, and female workers would be uncomfortable, and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The holonews was full of such proposals and discussions, of course, and orations about the unforeseen consequences of the Open Gate Law, the proper place of men, male capacities and limitations, gender as destiny. Feeling against the Open Gate policy ran very strong, and it seemed that every time I watched the holo there was a woman talking grimly about the inherent violence and irresponsibility of the male, his biological unfitness to participate in social and political decision-making. Often it was a man saying the same things. Opposition to the new law had the fervent support of all the conservatives in the castles, who pleaded eloquently for the gates to be closed and men to return to their proper station, pursuing the true, masculine glory of the games and the fuckeries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Glory did not tempt me, after the years at Rakedr Castle; the word itself had come to mean degradation to me. I ranted against the games and competitions, puzzling most of my family, who loved to watch the Maingames and wrestling, and complained only that the level of excellence of most of the teams had declined since the gates were opened. And I ranted against the fuckeries, where, I said, men were used as cattle, stud bulls, not as human beings. I would never go there again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“But my dear boy,” my mother said at last, alone with me one evening, “will you live the rest of your life celibate?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I hope not,” I said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Then… ?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I want to get married.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her eyes widened. She brooded a bit, and finally ventured, “To a man.”“No. To a woman. I want a normal, ordinary marriage. I want to have a wife and be a wife.”Shocking as the idea was, she tried to absorb it. She pondered, frowning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“All it means,” I said, for I had had a long time with nothing to do but ponder, “is that we’d live together just like any married pair. We’d set up our own daughterhouse, and be faithful to each other, and if she had a child I’d be its lovemother along with her. There isn’t any reason why it wouldn’t work!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Well, I don’t know — I don’t know of any,” said my mother, gentle and judicious, and never happy at saying no to me. “But you do have to find the woman, you know.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I know,” I said glumly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“It’s such a problem for you to meet people,” she said. “Perhaps if you went to the fuckery… ? I don’t see why your own motherhouse couldn’t guarantee you just as well as a castle. We could try — ?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I passionately refused. Not being one of Fassaw’s sycophants, I had seldom been allowed to go to the fuckery; and my few experiences there had been unfortunate. Young, inexperienced, and without recommendation, I had been selected by older women who wanted a plaything. Their practiced skill at arousing me had left me humiliated and enraged. They patted and tipped me as they left. That elaborate, mechanical excitation and their condescending coldness were vile to me, after the tenderness of my lover-protectors in the Castle. Yet women attracted me physically as men never had; the beautiful bodies of my sisters and their wives, all around me constantly now, clothed and naked, innocent and sensual, the wonderful heaviness and strength and softness of women’s bodies, kept me continually aroused. Every night I masturbated, fantasizing my sisters in my arms. It was unendurable. Again I was a ghost, a raging, yearning impotence in the midst of untouchable reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I began to think I would have to go back to the Castle. I sank into a deep depression, an inertia, a chill darkness of the mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My family, anxious, affectionate, busy, had no idea what to do for me or with me. I think most of them thought in their hearts that it would be best if I went back through the gate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One afternoon my sister Pado, with whom I had been closest as a child, came to my room — they had cleared out a dormer attic for me, so that I had room at least in the literal sense. She found me in my now constant lethargy, lying on the bed doing nothing at all. She breezed in, and with the indifference women often show to moods and signals, plumped down on the foot of the bed and said, “Hey, what do you know about the man who’s here from the Ekumen?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I shrugged and shut my eyes. I had been having rape fantasies lately. I was afraid of her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She talked on about the offworlder, who was apparently in Rakedr to study the Mutiny. “He wants to talk to the resistance,” she said. “Men like you. The men who opened the gates. He says they won’t come forward, as if they were ashamed of being heroes.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Heroes!” I said. The word in my language is gendered female. It refers to the semi-divine, semi-historic protagonists of the Epics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“It’s what you are,” Pado said, intensity breaking through her assumed breeziness. “You took responsibility in a great act. Maybe you did it wrong. Sassume did it wrong in the &lt;em>Founding of Emmo&lt;/em>, didn’t she, she let Faradr get killed. But she was still a hero. She took the responsibility. So did you. You ought to go talk to this Alien. Tell him what happened. Nobody really knows what happened at the Castle. You owe us the story.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was a powerful phrase, among my people. “The untold story mothers the lie,” was the saying. The doer of any notable act was held literally &lt;em>accountable&lt;/em> for it to the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“So why should I tell it to an Alien?” I said, defensive of my inertia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Because he’ll listen,” my sister said dryly. “We’re all too damned busy.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was profoundly true. Pado had seen a gate for me and opened it; and I went through it, having just enough strength and sanity left to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mobile Noem was a man in his forties, born some centuries earlier on Terra, trained on Hain, widely traveled; a small, yellow-brown, quick-eyed person, very easy to talk to. He did not seem at all masculine to me, at first; I kept thinking he was a woman, because he acted like one. He got right to business, with none of the maneuvering to assert his authority or jockeying for position that men of my society felt obligatory in any relationship with another man. I was used to men being wary, indirect, and competitive. Noem, like a woman, was direct and receptive. He was also as subtle and powerful as any man or woman I had known, even Ragaz. His authority was in fact immense; but he never stood on it. He sat down on it, comfortably, and invited you to sit down with him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was the first of the Rakedr mutineers to come forward and tell our story to him. He recorded it, with my permission, to use in making his report to the Stabiles on the condition of our society, “the matter of Seggri,” as he called it. My first description of the Mutiny took less than an hour. I thought I was done. I didn’t know, then, the inexhaustible desire to learn, to understand, to hear &lt;em>all&lt;/em> the story, that characterizes the Mobiles of the Ekumen. Noem asked questions, I answered; he speculated and extrapolated, I corrected; he wanted details, I furnished them — telling the story of the Mutiny, of the years before it, of the men of the Castle, of the women of the Town, of my people, of my life — little by little, bit by bit, all in fragments, a muddle. I talked to Noem daily for a month. I learned that the story has no beginning, and no story has an end. That the story is all muddle, all middle. That the story is never true, but that the lie is indeed a child of silence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the end of the month I had come to love and trust Noem, and of course to depend on him. Talking to him had become my reason for being. I tried to face the fact that he would not stay in Rakedr much longer. I must learn to do without him. Do what? There were things for men to do, ways for men to live, he proved it by his mere existence; but could I find them?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He was keenly aware of my situation, and would not let me withdraw, as I began to do, into the lethargy of fear again; he would not let me be silent. He asked me impossible questions. “What would you be if you could be anything?” he asked me, a question children ask each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I answered at once, passionately — “A wife!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know now what the flicker that crossed his face was. His quick, kind eyes watched me, looked away, looked back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I want my own family,” I said. “Not to live in my mothers’ house, where I’m always a child. Work. A wife, wives — children — to be a mother. I want life, not games!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“You can’t bear a child,” he said gently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“No, but I can mother one!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“We gender the word,” he said. “I like it better your way… But tell me, Ardar, what are the chances of your marrying — meeting a woman willing to marry a man? It hasn’t happened, here, has it?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had to say no, not to my knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“It will happen, certainly, I think,” he said (his certainties were always uncertain). “But the personal cost, at first, is likely to be high. Relationships formed against the negative pressure of a society are under terrible strain; they tend to become defensive, over-intense, unpeaceful. They have no room to grow.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Room!” I said. And I tried to tell him my feeling of having no room in my world, no air to breathe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He looked at me, scratching his nose; he laughed. “There’s plenty of room in the galaxy, you know,” he said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Do you mean… I could… That the Ekumen…” I didn’t even know what the question I wanted to ask was. Noem did. He began to answer it thoughtfully and in detail. My education so far had been so limited, even as regards the culture of my own people, that I would have to attend a college for at least two or three years, in order to be ready to apply to an offworld institution such as the Ekumenical Schools on Hain. Of course, he went on, where I went and what kind of training I chose would depend on my interests, which I would go to a college to discover, since neither my schooling as a child nor my training at the Castle had really given me any idea of what there was to be interested in. The choices offered me had been unbelievably limited, addressing neither the needs of a normally intelligent person nor the needs of my society. And so the Open Gate Law instead of giving me freedom had left me “with no air to breathe but airless Space,” said Noem, quoting some poet from some planet somewhere. My head was spinning, full of stars. “Hagka College is quite near Rakedr,” Noem said, “did you never think of applying? If only to escape from your terrible Castle?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I shook my head. “Lord Fassaw always destroyed the application forms when they were sent to his office. If any of us had tried to apply… -”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“You would have been punished. Tortured, I suppose. Yes. Well, from the little I know of your colleges, I think your life there would be better than it is here, but not altogether pleasant. You will have work to do, a place to be; but you will be made to feel marginal, inferior. Even highly educated, enlightened women have difficulty accepting men as their intellectual equals. Believe me, I have experienced it myself! And because you were trained at the Castle to compete, to want to excel, you may find it hard to be among people who either believe you incapable of excellence, or to whom the concept of competition, of winning and defeating, is valueless. But just there, there is where you will find air to breathe.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Noem recommended me to women he knew on the faculty of Hagka College, and I was enrolled on probation. My family were delighted to pay my tuition. I was the first of us to go to college, and they were genuinely proud of me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As Noem had predicted, it was not always easy, but there were enough other men there that I found friends and was not caught in the paralyzing isolation of the motherhouse. And as I took courage, I made friends among the women students, finding many of them unprejudiced and companionable. In my third year, one of them and I managed, tentatively and warily, to fall in love. It did not work very well or last very long, yet it was a great liberation for both of us, our liberation from the belief that the only communication or commonality possible between us was sexual, that an adult man and woman had nothing to join them but their genitals. Emadr loathed the professionalism of the fuckery as I did, and our lovemaking was always shy and brief. Its true significance was not as a consummation of desire, but as proof that we could trust each other. Where our real passion broke loose was when we lay together talking, telling each other what our lives had been, how we felt about men and women and each other and ourselves, what our nightmares were, what our dreams were. We talked endlessly, in a communion that I will cherish and honor all my life, two young souls finding their wings, flying together, not for long, but high. The first flight is the highest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Emadr has been dead two hundred years; she stayed on Seggri, married into a motherhouse, bore two children, taught at Hagka, and died in her seventies. I went to Hain, to the Ekumenical Schools, and later to Werel and Yeowe as part of the Mobile’s staff; my record is herewith enclosed. I have written this sketch of my life as part of my application to return to Seggri as a Mobile of the Ekumen. I want very much to live among my people, to learn who they are, now that I know with at least an uncertain certainty who I am.&lt;/p></description><category domain="https://zdaneel.github.io/femi/">femi</category></item></channel></rss>
